## Why Are Some Countries Poor?

This is perhaps the most important question in economics. In 1979, the Nobel Prize went to two men who attacked it from complementary angles. Arthur Lewis, born in the small Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, built a model showing how poor agricultural economies transform into industrial ones — the mechanics of development. Theodore Schultz, an American agricultural economist, showed that the key to development isn't machines or factories — it's people. Invest in education, health, and skills, and even the poorest farmers become engines of growth.

Together, they founded modern development economics and changed how the world thinks about poverty.

## Lewis: The Dual-Sector Model

**W. Arthur Lewis (1915–1991)** published his landmark paper *Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour* in 1954. It became one of the most influential papers in economics.

Lewis observed that developing countries have a **dual economy** — two sectors that operate by completely different rules:

- **The traditional sector** (subsistence agriculture): Characterized by surplus labor — more workers than needed. The marginal product of labor is near zero. Removing a worker from the farm barely reduces output. Wages are at subsistence level
- **The modern sector** (industry, manufacturing): Operates on capitalist principles. Pays wages slightly above subsistence to attract workers from the countryside. Generates profits that can be reinvested

The engine of development:

1. Capitalists in the modern sector hire surplus workers from agriculture at low wages
2. Because labor is abundant, wages stay low and profits stay high
3. Capitalists reinvest profits, expanding the modern sector
4. More workers are absorbed from agriculture
5. This continues until the surplus labor is exhausted — the **Lewis turning point**
6. After the turning point, wages begin to rise across the entire economy

This model captured the experience of countries like Japan, South Korea, and later China — where massive migration from farms to factories powered decades of rapid industrialization. Lewis also analyzed the terms of trade between developing and developed countries, arguing that poor countries exporting primary commodities faced systematically declining terms of trade — a structural disadvantage in the global economy.

Lewis was the first Black person to receive a Nobel Prize in a category other than Peace — a fitting recognition for a scholar who devoted his life to understanding why the world's poorest people remain poor.

## Schultz: Poor People Are Rational — They Just Lack Investment

**Theodore Schultz (1902–1998)** challenged a deeply held prejudice: that farmers in developing countries are backward, tradition-bound, and resistant to change. Through careful empirical research, he proved the opposite.

His key insight in *Transforming Traditional Agriculture* (1964):

- **Poor farmers are rational**: They allocate their scarce resources efficiently given the technology and information available to them. They're not inefficient — they're operating at the frontier of what's possible with traditional methods
- **The problem isn't motivation — it's opportunity**: What poor farmers lack isn't rationality but access to better seeds, better techniques, education, and health care. Give them modern inputs and knowledge, and they respond quickly and effectively
- **The Green Revolution proved him right**: When high-yield crop varieties became available in India and other developing countries, farmers adopted them rapidly — exactly as Schultz predicted rational actors would

From this foundation, Schultz developed **human capital theory** — the idea that people are not just labor inputs but investments:

- **Education is investment, not consumption**: Spending on schooling yields returns just like spending on machinery — higher productivity, higher earnings, better decision-making
- **Health is capital**: A healthy worker is a more productive worker. Investments in nutrition, sanitation, and healthcare have enormous economic returns in developing countries
- **Research and extension**: Agricultural research and the systems that bring new knowledge to farmers are among the highest-return investments a developing country can make
- **Entrepreneurial ability**: The capacity to deal with disequilibria — to adapt, innovate, and reallocate resources when conditions change — is itself a form of human capital that education develops

## Two Views, One Revolution

Lewis and Schultz approached development from different angles but reached complementary conclusions:

| | Lewis | Schultz |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Structural transformation | Human capital investment |
| **Key mechanism** | Labor transfer from agriculture to industry | Education, health, and technology for farmers |
| **View of agriculture** | Source of surplus labor for industry | A productive sector that responds to investment |
| **View of the poor** | Trapped in low-productivity subsistence | Rational agents lacking opportunities |
| **Policy implication** | Industrialize by absorbing surplus labor | Invest in people — education, health, research |

Their 1979 Nobel Prize was awarded "for their pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries."

## Explain It to a Child

> Lewis said: imagine a farm with 10 workers but only enough work for 5. The extra 5 could move to a factory in the city, make things, earn money, and the farm would produce just as much as before. That's how poor countries get richer — by moving people from where they're not needed to where they are. Schultz said: wait — don't forget the farmers who stay. If you teach them better farming, give them better seeds, and keep them healthy, they can grow twice as much food. The real secret to development isn't just building factories — it's investing in people.

## 为什么有些国家贫穷？

这也许是经济学中最重要的问题。1979年，诺贝尔奖颁给了从互补角度攻克这一问题的两个人。阿瑟·刘易斯，出生于加勒比小岛圣卢西亚，建立了一个模型展示贫穷的农业经济如何转变为工业经济——发展的机制。西奥多·舒尔茨，美国农业经济学家，证明了发展的关键不是机器或工厂——而是人。投资于教育、健康和技能，即使最贫穷的农民也能成为增长的引擎。

他们共同创立了现代发展经济学，改变了世界对贫困的思考方式。

## 刘易斯：二元经济模型

**W·阿瑟·刘易斯（1915–1991）** 于1954年发表了里程碑式论文《劳动力无限供给下的经济发展》，成为经济学中最有影响力的论文之一。

刘易斯观察到发展中国家存在**二元经济**——两个按完全不同规则运行的部门：

- **传统部门**（自给农业）：特征是劳动力过剩——工人多于所需。劳动的边际产出接近零。从农场移走一个工人几乎不减少产出。工资处于维持生存的水平
- **现代部门**（工业、制造业）：按资本主义原则运行。支付略高于生存水平的工资以吸引农村工人。产生可以再投资的利润

发展的引擎：

1. 现代部门的资本家以低工资从农业中雇用剩余工人
2. 因为劳动力充裕，工资保持低位，利润保持高位
3. 资本家将利润再投资，扩大现代部门
4. 更多工人从农业中被吸收
5. 这一过程持续到剩余劳动力耗尽——**刘易斯转折点**
6. 转折点之后，整个经济的工资开始上升

这一模型捕捉了日本、韩国以及后来中国的经验——大规模的从农场到工厂的迁移驱动了数十年的快速工业化。刘易斯还分析了发展中国家与发达国家之间的贸易条件，论证出口初级商品的穷国面临系统性恶化的贸易条件——全球经济中的结构性劣势。

刘易斯是第一位在和平奖以外类别获得诺贝尔奖的黑人——这是对一位毕生致力于理解世界上最贫穷的人为何依然贫穷的学者的恰当认可。

## 舒尔茨：穷人是理性的——他们只是缺乏投资

**西奥多·舒尔茨（1902–1998）** 挑战了一个根深蒂固的偏见：发展中国家的农民是落后的、因循守旧的、抗拒变化的。通过细致的实证研究，他证明了恰恰相反。

他在《改造传统农业》（1964年）中的核心洞见：

- **贫穷的农民是理性的**：在可用的技术和信息条件下，他们有效地分配了稀缺资源。他们不是低效的——他们在传统方法所能达到的前沿上运作
- **问题不在于动机——而在于机会**：穷农民缺乏的不是理性，而是更好的种子、更好的技术、教育和医疗。给他们现代投入品和知识，他们会迅速而有效地做出反应
- **绿色革命证明了他的正确**：当高产作物品种在印度和其他发展中国家推广时，农民迅速采用——正如舒尔茨预测理性行为者会做的那样

在此基础上，舒尔茨发展了**人力资本理论**——人不仅仅是劳动投入，更是投资：

- **教育是投资，不是消费**：教育支出像机器投资一样产生回报——更高的生产率、更高的收入、更好的决策能力
- **健康是资本**：健康的工人是更有生产力的工人。在发展中国家，营养、卫生和医疗保健的投资有巨大的经济回报
- **研究与推广**：农业研究以及将新知识传递给农民的体系，是发展中国家回报率最高的投资之一
- **企业家能力**：应对非均衡的能力——在条件变化时适应、创新和重新配置资源——本身就是教育所培养的一种人力资本

## 两种视角，一场革命

刘易斯和舒尔茨从不同角度切入发展问题，但得出了互补的结论：

| | 刘易斯 | 舒尔茨 |
|---|---|---|
| **关注点** | 结构转型 | 人力资本投资 |
| **关键机制** | 劳动力从农业转移到工业 | 为农民提供教育、健康和技术 |
| **对农业的看法** | 为工业提供剩余劳动力的来源 | 对投资有响应的生产性部门 |
| **对穷人的看法** | 困在低生产率的自给经济中 | 缺乏机会的理性主体 |
| **政策含义** | 通过吸收剩余劳动力实现工业化 | 投资于人——教育、健康、研究 |

他们1979年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对经济发展的开创性研究，特别关注发展中国家的问题。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 刘易斯说：想象一个农场有10个工人，但只有5个人的活。多出来的5个人可以搬到城里的工厂，做东西、赚钱，而农场的产出和以前一样多。穷国就是这样变富的——把人从不需要他们的地方转移到需要他们的地方。舒尔茨说：等等——别忘了留下来的农民。如果你教他们更好的种地方法，给他们更好的种子，保持他们的健康，他们能种出两倍的粮食。发展的真正秘密不只是建工厂——而是投资于人。
