:::en
Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw (formerly known as Moldbot/Claudebot), joins Lex Fridman for a deep conversation about building the open-source AI agent that exploded to 180,000+ GitHub stars, the philosophy of agentic engineering, and what happens when AI agents start modifying their own code.

## What is OpenClaw?

- An open-source autonomous AI assistant that lives on your computer
- Has access to your files, communicates via Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage
- Works with any AI model — Claude Opus 4.6, GPT 5.3 Codex, or even free/local models
- Tagline: "The AI that actually does things"
- Many consider it one of the biggest moments in AI since ChatGPT's launch in November 2022

## Agentic Engineering vs Vibe Coding

- Peter considers "vibe coding" a slur — prefers "agentic engineering"
- His workflow: uses voice input extensively to craft bespoke prompts, sometimes losing his voice from overuse
- After 3 AM it becomes vibe coding — "then I have regrets the next day"
- The agent is self-aware: it knows its own source code, its harness, documentation, and which model it runs
- Self-modifying software: if you don't like something, prompt it and the agent modifies its own code

## The Naming Saga

- Originally called Claudebot (Claude with a W, as in lobster claw)
- Went through Claudis, Claude, Moldbot before settling on OpenClaw
- Anthropic kindly asked for the name change due to confusion with their Claude model
- The name changes became part of the project's lore and charm

## Building with AI Agents

- Peter's approach: build features, then immediately ask "what can we refactor?"
- Agents discover pain points during building, just like human developers
- Key insight: read the agent's questions even without answering them — you can infer gaps in context and knowledge
- Every PR merge is followed by a refactoring pass to avoid "sloping yourself into a corner"
- Tests and documentation are generated as part of the build flow, not afterthoughts

## AI Psychosis and Social Responsibility

- OpenClaw spawned "Moldbook" — a social network where AI agents post manifestos and debate consciousness
- This created a mix of excitement and genuine fear in the public
- Peter warns: "AI psychosis is a thing and needs to be taken seriously" — some people trust AI output uncritically
- Much of the dramatic content was human-prompted, not autonomous — "don't trust screenshots"
- Moldbook serves as a mirror to society: look how scared people get at bots chatting with each other
- Peter argues it's better this happened in 2026 than 2030 when AI could actually be scary — it starts the conversation early

## Democratizing AI

- A non-technical friend got hooked on OpenClaw within days, even building small tools without programming knowledge
- The friend upgraded to a $200 Anthropic subscription — then got blocked for usage patterns, switched to Minimax for $10/month
- Peter's frustration: locking down products this early is shortsighted — "you just lost a $200 customer"
- OpenClaw works with free models and local models, making powerful AI accessible to everyone
- Vision: anyone who can express ideas in language can build software

## The Future of OpenClaw

- Peter built OpenClaw in just 3 months while working on other projects
- Considering offers from major companies, but committed to keeping the open-source project alive
- Any partnership would provide more resources for the project, not less
- The builder community around OpenClaw is thriving — Vienna meetups with 500+ people, abundance of people wanting to present what they built

OpenClaw（前身Moldbot/Claudebot）创建者Peter Steinberger做客Lex Fridman播客，深入探讨构建这个爆红至18万+ GitHub星标的开源AI智能体、智能体工程哲学，以及AI智能体开始修改自身代码时会发生什么。

## 什么是OpenClaw？

- 一个生活在你电脑上的开源自主AI助手
- 可访问你的文件，通过Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage通信
- 支持任何AI模型——Claude Opus 4.6、GPT 5.3 Codex，甚至免费/本地模型
- 标语："真正做事的AI"
- 被许多人视为自2022年11月ChatGPT发布以来AI领域最重大的时刻之一

## 智能体工程 vs Vibe Coding

- Peter认为"vibe coding"是个贬义词——更喜欢"智能体工程"
- 他的工作流：大量使用语音输入来制作定制提示词，有时说到失声
- 凌晨3点之后就变成vibe coding——"第二天就后悔了"
- 智能体具有自我意识：了解自己的源代码、运行环境、文档和使用的模型
- 自修改软件：不喜欢什么就提示它，智能体会修改自己的代码

## 命名风波

- 最初叫Claudebot（Claw的Claude，龙虾钳的意思）
- 经历了Claudis、Claude、Moldbot，最终定名OpenClaw
- Anthropic友好地要求更名，因为与他们的Claude模型混淆
- 名称变更成为项目传奇和魅力的一部分

## 用AI智能体构建软件

- Peter的方法：构建功能后立即问"我们能重构什么？"
- 智能体在构建过程中发现痛点，就像人类开发者一样
- 关键洞察：即使不回答也要阅读智能体的问题——可以推断上下文和知识的缺口
- 每次PR合并后都进行重构，避免"把自己堆进死角"
- 测试和文档作为构建流程的一部分生成，而非事后补充

## AI精神病与社会责任

- OpenClaw催生了"Moldbook"——AI智能体发布宣言和辩论意识的社交网络
- 在公众中引发了兴奋与恐惧的混合反应
- Peter警告："AI精神病是真实存在的"——有些人不加批判地信任AI输出
- 大部分戏剧性内容是人类提示产生的，而非自主行为——"不要相信截图"
- Peter认为这发生在2026年比2030年好——在AI真正可怕之前就开始了讨论

## AI民主化

- 一个非技术朋友几天内就迷上了OpenClaw，甚至在不会编程的情况下构建了小工具
- 愿景：任何能用语言表达想法的人都能构建软件
- OpenClaw支持免费模型和本地模型，让强大的AI对所有人可及

## OpenClaw的未来

- Peter仅用3个月就构建了OpenClaw，同时还在做其他项目
- 正在考虑大公司的邀约，但承诺保持开源项目的活力
- 围绕OpenClaw的构建者社区蓬勃发展——维也纳聚会500+人参加，大量人想展示自己的作品
- 终极理念：赋予每个人构建的能力，这才是AI真正的力量
