## Economics Meets Real People

For most of its history, economics assumed that people are rational, self-interested, and have unlimited willpower. They calculate costs and benefits perfectly, save the right amount for retirement, and never make decisions they later regret.

Richard Thaler looked at actual human beings and said: that's not how any of this works.

People procrastinate. They treat money differently depending on which mental "jar" it's in. They refuse deals that feel unfair even when accepting would make them richer. They lack the self-control to diet, save, or exercise — even when they genuinely want to. Thaler didn't just document these quirks — he built them into economic theory and then designed practical tools to help people overcome their own limitations.

## Mental Accounting: Money Isn't Fungible in Your Head

Standard economics says a dollar is a dollar — it doesn't matter whether it came from your salary, a lottery win, or a tax refund. Thaler showed that people violate this principle constantly through **mental accounting**:

- People create separate mental "accounts" for different purposes — a vacation fund, a rainy-day fund, grocery money. They won't raid the vacation fund to pay for groceries, even if it's the same money in the same bank
- A tax refund feels like "free money" and gets spent on luxuries, while the same amount from regular income would be saved
- People who lose a $100 theater ticket won't buy another one, but people who lose $100 cash on the way to the theater will still buy the ticket — even though the financial loss is identical
- Investors treat gains and losses in individual stocks separately rather than looking at their portfolio as a whole — leading to the **disposition effect** (selling winners too early and holding losers too long)

Mental accounting isn't always irrational — it can be a useful self-control device. But it leads to systematic patterns that standard economics can't explain and that have real consequences for saving, spending, and investing.

## Social Preferences: Fairness Matters

Thaler showed that people care deeply about fairness — and will sacrifice money to punish unfairness:

- **The ultimatum game**: One player proposes how to split $10. The other can accept or reject — if they reject, both get nothing. Rational theory says accept any positive offer. In practice, people reject offers below about $3, preferring to get nothing rather than accept an "unfair" split
- **The dictator game**: When the proposer has all the power (the other can't reject), most people still share — typically giving 20-30%. Pure self-interest predicts they'd keep everything
- **Fairness in markets**: Thaler documented that consumers punish firms they perceive as unfair. A hardware store that raises snow shovel prices after a blizzard will lose customers — even though supply and demand justify the increase. Firms know this and often maintain "fair" prices at the cost of short-term profits

## Limited Self-Control: The Planner vs. the Doer

Thaler modeled the human mind as containing two selves — a far-sighted **planner** who wants to save for retirement and eat healthy, and a short-sighted **doer** who wants to spend now and eat cake.

This **planner-doer model** explains:

- Why people set alarm clocks (the planner constraining the doer's desire to sleep)
- Why people buy gym memberships they don't use (the planner's optimism about the doer's future behavior)
- Why people put money in Christmas savings accounts that pay no interest (the planner locking money away from the doer)
- Why retirement savings are chronically inadequate — the doer always wins the battle against the planner when the payoff is decades away

## The Endowment Effect and Status Quo Bias

Building on Kahneman and Tversky's loss aversion, Thaler identified the **endowment effect**: people value things more simply because they own them.

- In experiments, people given a coffee mug demand roughly twice as much to sell it as others are willing to pay to buy it — even though both groups value the mug equally before ownership is assigned
- This creates **status quo bias** — people stick with what they have, even when switching would be beneficial. They keep the default insurance plan, the default investment allocation, the default phone plan — not because they've evaluated the alternatives, but because changing feels like a loss

## Nudge: Choice Architecture That Helps

Thaler's most influential practical contribution was the concept of the **nudge** — small changes in how choices are presented that steer people toward better decisions without restricting their freedom.

The philosophy: **libertarian paternalism** — help people make better choices (paternalism) while preserving their right to choose otherwise (libertarian).

The most powerful nudges:

- **Default options**: When companies automatically enroll employees in retirement savings plans (with the option to opt out), participation jumps from about 50% to over 90%. The same people, the same plan, the same freedom — just a different default. Thaler's **Save More Tomorrow** program lets workers commit to saving a portion of future raises — exploiting inertia and loss aversion to build savings painlessly
- **Simplification**: Making forms simpler, reducing the number of options, and providing clear information all help people make better choices. Complex Medicare drug plans leave seniors confused; simplified comparisons help them choose wisely
- **Social norms**: Telling people that most of their neighbors conserve energy reduces their own energy use. Telling taxpayers that most people file on time increases compliance
- **Feedback**: Showing people their energy consumption compared to efficient neighbors motivates conservation. Making calorie counts visible at restaurants changes food choices

Nudge units — "behavioral insights teams" — now operate in governments worldwide, from the UK's original Behavioural Insights Team to units in the US, Australia, Singapore, and dozens of other countries.

His 2017 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his contributions to behavioural economics."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine your parents put a bowl of fruit and a bowl of candy on the kitchen counter. If the candy is in front, you grab candy. If the fruit is in front, you grab fruit. You're free to choose either one — nobody's forcing you. But where things are placed changes what you pick. That's a "nudge." Thaler discovered that people make choices based on how things are set up, not just what's best for them. He also found that people think about money in funny ways — birthday money feels different from allowance money, even though it's all just money. And people hate losing things more than they like getting things — if you give a kid a toy and then try to take it back, they'll be much more upset than if you'd never given it to them. Thaler used all these discoveries to help design systems that make it easier for people to save money, eat better, and make smarter choices — without taking away anyone's freedom to choose.

## 经济学遇见真实的人

在大部分历史中，经济学假设人是理性的、自利的、拥有无限意志力的。他们完美地计算成本和收益，为退休储蓄恰当的金额，从不做出日后后悔的决策。

塞勒看着真实的人说：这根本不是事情运作的方式。

人们拖延。他们根据钱在哪个心理"罐子"里而区别对待。他们拒绝感觉不公平的交易，即使接受会让他们更富有。他们缺乏节食、储蓄或锻炼的自控力——即使他们真心想做到。塞勒不仅记录了这些怪癖——他将它们构建到经济理论中，然后设计了帮助人们克服自身局限的实用工具。

---

## 心理账户：钱在你头脑中不是可替代的

标准经济学说一元就是一元——无论它来自工资、彩票还是退税都无所谓。塞勒证明人们通过**心理账户**不断违反这一原则：

- 人们为不同目的创建单独的心理"账户"——度假基金、应急基金、买菜钱。他们不会动用度假基金来买菜，即使是同一银行里的同一笔钱
- 退税感觉像"白得的钱"，会花在奢侈品上，而来自正常收入的同等金额会被储蓄
- 丢了100元戏票的人不会再买一张，但在去剧院路上丢了100元现金的人仍会买票——尽管经济损失完全相同
- 投资者分别对待个股的盈亏而非将投资组合作为整体看待——导致**处置效应**（过早卖出盈利股、过久持有亏损股）

心理账户并不总是非理性的——它可以是有用的自控工具。但它导致了标准经济学无法解释的系统性模式，并对储蓄、消费和投资产生真实后果。

## 社会偏好：公平很重要

塞勒证明人们深切关心公平——并愿意牺牲金钱来惩罚不公平：

- **最后通牒博弈**：一个玩家提议如何分10元。另一个可以接受或拒绝——如果拒绝，双方都得零。理性理论说接受任何正的提议。实践中，人们拒绝低于约3元的提议，宁愿什么都不得也不接受"不公平"的分配
- **独裁者博弈**：当提议者拥有全部权力（对方不能拒绝）时，大多数人仍然分享——通常给出20-30%。纯自利预测他们会全部留下
- **市场中的公平**：塞勒记录了消费者惩罚他们认为不公平的企业。暴风雪后提高雪铲价格的五金店会失去客户——即使供需证明涨价合理。企业知道这一点，经常以牺牲短期利润为代价维持"公平"价格

## 有限自控力：计划者vs.执行者

塞勒将人的心智建模为包含两个自我——远见的**计划者**想为退休储蓄、吃得健康，短视的**执行者**想现在就花钱、吃蛋糕。

这个**计划者-执行者模型**解释了：

- 为什么人们设闹钟（计划者约束执行者想继续睡的欲望）
- 为什么人们买了不用的健身会员（计划者对执行者未来行为的乐观）
- 为什么人们把钱放进不付利息的圣诞储蓄账户（计划者将钱锁起来远离执行者）
- 为什么退休储蓄长期不足——当回报在几十年后时，执行者总是赢得与计划者的战斗

## 禀赋效应与现状偏差

基于卡尼曼和特沃斯基的损失厌恶，塞勒识别了**禀赋效应**：人们仅仅因为拥有某物就更加珍视它。

- 在实验中，获得咖啡杯的人要求的卖价大约是其他人愿意支付买价的两倍——尽管在分配所有权之前两组人对杯子的估值相同
- 这创造了**现状偏差**——人们坚持已有的，即使切换更有利。他们保持默认保险计划、默认投资配置、默认手机套餐——不是因为他们评估了替代方案，而是因为改变感觉像损失

## 助推：帮助人的选择架构

塞勒最有影响力的实践贡献是**助推**的概念——通过微小改变选择的呈现方式，引导人们做出更好的决策而不限制他们的自由。

理念：**自由意志主义的温和家长制**——帮助人们做出更好的选择（家长制）同时保留他们选择其他方式的权利（自由意志主义）。

最强大的助推：

- **默认选项**：当公司自动将员工纳入退休储蓄计划（可以选择退出）时，参与率从约50%跃升到90%以上。同样的人、同样的计划、同样的自由——只是不同的默认设置。塞勒的**"明天存更多"**计划让工人承诺将未来加薪的一部分用于储蓄——利用惰性和损失厌恶无痛地积累储蓄
- **简化**：使表格更简单、减少选项数量、提供清晰信息都帮助人们做出更好的选择。复杂的医保药品计划让老人困惑；简化的比较帮助他们明智选择
- **社会规范**：告诉人们大多数邻居节约能源会减少他们自己的能源使用。告诉纳税人大多数人按时申报会提高合规率
- **反馈**：向人们展示与高效邻居相比的能源消耗激发节约。在餐厅显示卡路里计数改变食物选择

助推单位——"行为洞察团队"——现在在全球政府运作，从英国最初的行为洞察团队到美国、澳大利亚、新加坡和数十个其他国家的单位。

他2017年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对行为经济学的贡献。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你的父母在厨房台面上放了一碗水果和一碗糖果。如果糖果在前面，你拿糖果。如果水果在前面，你拿水果。你可以自由选择任何一个——没人强迫你。但东西放在哪里改变了你的选择。这就是"助推"。塞勒发现人们根据事物的设置方式做选择，而不仅仅是什么对他们最好。他还发现人们用有趣的方式想钱——生日钱感觉和零花钱不同，即使都只是钱。而且人们讨厌失去东西甚于喜欢得到东西——如果你给一个孩子一个玩具然后试图拿走，他们会比你从未给过他们更难过得多。塞勒利用所有这些发现来帮助设计系统，让人们更容易存钱、吃得更好、做出更聪明的选择——而不剥夺任何人选择的自由。
