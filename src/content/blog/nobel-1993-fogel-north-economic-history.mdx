## History Meets the Scientific Method

For most of its existence, economic history was a literary discipline — historians told stories about the past, supported by anecdotes and selective evidence. Two scholars changed this fundamentally. Robert Fogel brought the rigor of econometrics and counterfactual analysis, using data to test historical claims that had been accepted for generations. Douglass North brought economic theory, showing that institutions — the rules of the game — are the key to understanding why some societies grow rich while others remain poor.

Together, they created **cliometrics** — the application of economic theory and quantitative methods to history — and in doing so, they renewed both economic history and economics itself.

## Fogel: The Counterfactual Revolutionary

Robert Fogel's method was simple in principle and devastating in practice: **test historical claims with data, using counterfactual analysis.** Don't just assert that railroads were essential to American growth — build a model of what the economy would have looked like without them, and measure the difference.

**Railroads and American Economic Growth** (1964):

The conventional wisdom held that railroads were indispensable to American economic development — the single most important innovation of the 19th century. Fogel asked: what if there had been no railroads? What if America had relied instead on an extended network of canals, rivers, and roads?

His answer shocked the profession: the "social saving" of railroads — the difference between the actual economy and the counterfactual canal-based economy — was only about **2.7% of GDP** in 1890. Railroads mattered, but they were far from indispensable. The economy would have found alternative transportation solutions. No single innovation was the key to growth.

This wasn't an argument against railroads — it was an argument against technological determinism. Economic growth doesn't depend on any single invention; it depends on the broader system of incentives, institutions, and adaptability.

**Time on the Cross** (1974, with Stanley Engerman):

Fogel's most controversial work applied the same quantitative rigor to American slavery. Using plantation records, census data, and medical records, Fogel and Engerman argued:

- Slavery was economically profitable and efficient — not the dying institution that many historians had claimed
- Slave plantations achieved economies of scale that made them more productive per worker than free Northern farms
- Slave owners had economic incentives to maintain their workers' health and productivity

These findings provoked fierce debate. Critics challenged the data, the methods, and the moral implications. But the lasting contribution wasn't the specific conclusions — it was the demonstration that historical claims must be tested against evidence, not simply asserted.

## North: Institutions Are the Key

While Fogel revolutionized historical method, Douglass North revolutionized historical explanation. His central question: **why do some economies grow while others stagnate for centuries?**

The standard economic answer — technology and capital accumulation — was insufficient. Many societies had access to the same technologies but produced vastly different outcomes. North's answer: **institutions.**

Institutions are the "rules of the game" — the formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights) and informal constraints (customs, norms, traditions) that structure human interaction. They determine:

- **Whether innovation is rewarded**: In societies where property rights are secure and contracts are enforced, people invest and innovate. Where property can be seized by rulers or competitors, they don't
- **Whether exchange is possible**: Complex economic transactions require trust, enforcement, and predictability. Institutions provide these — reducing the transaction costs that would otherwise prevent trade
- **Whether growth is sustained**: Some institutional arrangements create virtuous cycles — growth strengthens institutions, which enable more growth. Others create vicious cycles — extractive institutions concentrate wealth and power, blocking change

## North's Framework: Institutions, Organizations, and Change

North developed a comprehensive theory of institutional change:

- **Institutions vs. organizations**: Institutions are the rules; organizations (firms, political parties, churches) are the players. Organizations form in response to the institutional framework and then work to change it in their favor
- **Path dependence**: History matters. Small initial differences in institutions can compound over centuries, producing vastly different outcomes. Once an economy is on a particular institutional path, switching is costly — explaining why inefficient institutions can persist for generations
- **The role of ideology**: North recognized that beliefs and mental models shape how people perceive their options. Institutions aren't just constraints — they reflect societies' understanding of how the world works
- **The Western miracle**: North traced the rise of the Western world to specific institutional innovations — secure property rights, independent courts, constitutional limits on rulers — that emerged in England and the Netherlands in the 17th century and spread unevenly across the globe

Their 1993 Nobel Prize was awarded "for having renewed research in economic history by applying economic theory and quantitative methods in order to explain economic and institutional change."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine two classrooms. In one, the teacher has clear rules: if you study hard, you get good grades, and nobody can steal your homework. In the other, the teacher changes the rules every day, and the biggest kid takes whatever they want. Which classroom will have students who study harder? That's what North discovered — countries with good rules (he called them "institutions") do better than countries with bad rules, even if they have the same books and teachers. And Fogel? He was like a detective for history. Everyone said trains made America rich. Fogel checked the numbers and said: "Actually, trains helped, but America would have found other ways to move stuff around." He showed that you can't just tell stories about history — you have to check the facts.

## 历史遇见科学方法

在其存在的大部分时间里，经济史是一门文学性学科——历史学家讲述关于过去的故事，以轶事和选择性证据为支撑。两位学者从根本上改变了这一点。福格尔带来了计量经济学和反事实分析的严谨性，用数据检验被接受了几代人的历史论断。诺斯带来了经济理论，证明制度——博弈的规则——是理解为什么有些社会变得富裕而其他社会仍然贫穷的关键。

他们共同创造了**计量经济史学**——将经济理论和定量方法应用于历史——并由此更新了经济史和经济学本身。

## 福格尔：反事实革命者

福格尔的方法原理简单，实践中却极具颠覆性：**用数据检验历史论断，使用反事实分析。** 不要仅仅断言铁路对美国增长不可或缺——构建一个没有铁路的经济模型，然后衡量差异。

**《铁路与美国经济增长》**（1964年）：

传统观点认为铁路对美国经济发展不可或缺——是19世纪最重要的单一创新。福格尔问：如果没有铁路呢？如果美国依赖的是扩展的运河、河流和公路网络呢？

他的答案震惊了学界：铁路的"社会节约"——实际经济与反事实的运河经济之间的差异——在1890年仅约占**GDP的2.7%**。铁路很重要，但远非不可或缺。经济会找到替代的运输方案。没有任何单一创新是增长的关键。

这不是反对铁路的论证——而是反对技术决定论的论证。经济增长不依赖于任何单一发明；它依赖于更广泛的激励、制度和适应性系统。

**《十字架上的时间》**（1974年，与斯坦利·恩格尔曼合著）：

福格尔最具争议的工作将同样的定量严谨性应用于美国奴隶制。利用种植园记录、人口普查数据和医疗记录，福格尔和恩格尔曼论证：

- 奴隶制在经济上是有利可图且高效的——不是许多历史学家所声称的垂死制度
- 奴隶种植园实现了规模经济，使其每个工人的生产力高于北方的自由农场
- 奴隶主有经济激励来维护工人的健康和生产力

这些发现引发了激烈辩论。批评者质疑数据、方法和道德含义。但持久的贡献不在于具体结论——而在于证明历史论断必须用证据检验，而非简单断言。

## 诺斯：制度是关键

福格尔革新了历史方法，诺斯则革新了历史解释。他的核心问题：**为什么有些经济体增长而其他经济体停滞数百年？**

标准的经济学答案——技术和资本积累——是不够的。许多社会获得了相同的技术却产生了截然不同的结果。诺斯的答案：**制度。**

制度是"博弈的规则"——正式规则（宪法、法律、产权）和非正式约束（习俗、规范、传统）构成了人类互动的结构。它们决定了：

- **创新是否得到回报**：在产权安全、合同得到执行的社会中，人们投资和创新。在财产可能被统治者或竞争者夺取的地方，他们不会
- **交换是否可能**：复杂的经济交易需要信任、执行和可预测性。制度提供这些——降低了否则会阻止贸易的交易成本
- **增长是否可持续**：某些制度安排创造良性循环——增长强化制度，制度促进更多增长。其他安排创造恶性循环——掠夺性制度集中财富和权力，阻碍变革

## 诺斯的框架：制度、组织与变迁

诺斯发展了一套完整的制度变迁理论：

- **制度 vs. 组织**：制度是规则；组织（企业、政党、教会）是参与者。组织在制度框架下形成，然后努力改变制度以利于自己
- **路径依赖**：历史很重要。制度上的微小初始差异可以在几个世纪中复合，产生截然不同的结果。一旦经济走上特定的制度路径，转换成本高昂——解释了为什么低效制度可以持续几代人
- **意识形态的作用**：诺斯认识到信念和心智模型塑造了人们对选择的感知。制度不仅仅是约束——它们反映了社会对世界如何运作的理解
- **西方奇迹**：诺斯将西方世界的崛起追溯到特定的制度创新——安全的产权、独立的法院、对统治者的宪法限制——这些在17世纪的英格兰和荷兰出现，并不均匀地传播到全球

他们1993年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其通过应用经济理论和定量方法来解释经济和制度变迁，从而更新了经济史研究。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象两间教室。在一间里，老师有明确的规则：如果你努力学习，你就能得到好成绩，没有人能偷你的作业。在另一间里，老师每天都改规则，最大的孩子想拿什么就拿什么。哪间教室的学生会更努力学习？这就是诺斯的发现——有好规则（他称之为"制度"）的国家比规则差的国家做得更好，即使它们有同样的书本和老师。而福格尔呢？他就像历史的侦探。所有人都说火车让美国变富了。福格尔核查了数据说："实际上，火车有帮助，但美国会找到其他方式来运输东西。"他证明了你不能只讲历史故事——你必须核查事实。
