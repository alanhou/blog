## The Problem With Good Intentions

For decades, development economics was dominated by grand theories and grand debates. Should poor countries focus on free markets or state planning? Aid or trade? Education or infrastructure? Billions of dollars hung on these arguments — but nobody was testing the answers.

Meanwhile, on the ground, poverty remained stubbornly persistent. Over 700 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day. Children in poor countries died of diseases that cost pennies to prevent. Schools were built but teachers didn't show up. Clinics were stocked but patients stayed away. Something was clearly not working — but what?

Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer proposed a radical idea: **stop debating grand theories and start running experiments.** Borrow the randomized controlled trial from medicine, apply it to development programs, and let the evidence decide what works. Their approach didn't just provide better answers — it changed the questions development economists ask.

## Kremer: The Pioneer in Kenya

In the mid-1990s, Michael Kremer was working in western Kenya, trying to figure out why schools in poor countries performed so badly. The conventional wisdom had many answers — too few textbooks, too few teachers, too little funding. But which one mattered most?

Kremer did something that development economists had rarely done before: he **ran an experiment**. Working with a Dutch NGO, he randomly assigned schools to receive different interventions — free textbooks, flip charts, extra teachers — and measured the results.

The findings were surprising and humbling:

- **Free textbooks didn't help** — at least not for the average student. Textbooks were written for the best students and left most behind
- **Flip charts didn't help** either
- **What did help?** Treating children for intestinal worms. Deworming was cheap (about 50 cents per child per year), dramatically improved school attendance, and had spillover benefits to untreated children nearby

This single experiment overturned years of assumptions. It showed that the binding constraint on education wasn't what anyone expected — it was health. And it demonstrated the power of rigorous experimentation to reveal surprises that theory and intuition miss.

## Banerjee and Duflo: Scaling the Method

Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, both at MIT, took Kremer's experimental approach and built it into a systematic research program covering education, health, agriculture, credit, and governance across dozens of countries.

Their core insight: **poverty is not one big problem — it's many small problems.** And each small problem can be studied with a carefully designed experiment.

**How an RCT works in development**:

- Identify a specific intervention — say, offering free bed nets to prevent malaria
- Randomly divide communities into a treatment group (gets the bed nets) and a control group (doesn't — yet)
- Measure outcomes in both groups after a set period
- The difference in outcomes is the causal effect of the intervention — not contaminated by selection bias, pre-existing differences, or wishful thinking

**Key findings from their experiments**:

- **Immunization**: In Indian villages, providing a small incentive (a bag of lentils) at immunization camps boosted child immunization rates from 6% to 38%. The problem wasn't ignorance or opposition — it was the hassle of getting to a distant clinic on a specific day
- **Education**: Hiring extra teaching assistants to help struggling students improved test scores far more than reducing class sizes or providing more textbooks. The problem wasn't resources — it was that teaching wasn't tailored to students' actual level
- **Microfinance**: Microcredit — small loans to the poor — was widely celebrated as a silver bullet for poverty. Rigorous RCTs showed the reality was more modest: microcredit helped some people start small businesses, but didn't produce the transformative effects its advocates claimed. No magic bullet
- **Savings**: The poor often don't save — not because they don't want to, but because saving is inconvenient and the temptation to spend is constant. Simple nudges — labeled savings accounts, commitment devices, automatic deposits — significantly increased savings rates
- **Agriculture**: Kenyan farmers knew that fertilizer increased yields but still didn't use it. Why? Not ignorance, but procrastination. Offering a small discount at harvest time (when farmers had cash) dramatically increased fertilizer adoption — more than a larger subsidy offered later

## J-PAL: The Infrastructure of Evidence

In 2003, Banerjee, Duflo, and Sendhil Mullainathan founded the **Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)** at MIT — a research center dedicated to running and coordinating RCTs in development economics.

J-PAL transformed the field:

- A network of nearly 200 affiliated researchers conducting over 1,000 RCTs in more than 80 countries
- Programs validated by J-PAL evidence have been scaled up to reach over 400 million people worldwide
- Governments in India, Indonesia, Peru, and dozens of other countries now use RCT evidence to design policy
- J-PAL created a model for "evidence-based policy" that influenced fields far beyond economics

Kremer also helped found the **Development Innovation Ventures** program at USAID and the **Global Innovation Fund**, creating pipelines to scale successful interventions from lab to policy.

## What Experiments Revealed About Poverty

Beyond any single finding, the experimental approach revealed deep patterns about how the poor make decisions:

- **The poor are rational but constrained**: They make reasonable choices given their circumstances — but those circumstances include constant stress, limited information, and zero margin for error. A bad harvest or a sick child can undo years of progress
- **Small barriers have huge effects**: Charging even a tiny fee for bed nets, deworming pills, or water purification drops drastically reduces adoption. Free distribution works far better — not because the poor can't afford pennies, but because any friction point becomes an excuse not to act when you're overwhelmed by daily survival
- **Default settings matter as much for the poor as for the rich**: Just as Thaler's nudges work in wealthy countries, default enrollment, automatic reminders, and simplification of procedures dramatically improve outcomes in poor countries
- **Context is everything**: An intervention that works in Kenya may fail in India. A program that works for women may not work for men. RCTs force humility — the only way to know is to test

## The Limits of Experiments

The experimental approach is powerful but not unlimited. Critics have raised important concerns:

- **External validity**: Does a result in one village generalize to an entire country? To a different country? Scaling up a small experiment can change the dynamics entirely
- **Big questions are hard to randomize**: You can randomize bed nets, but you can't randomize trade policy, institutions, or political systems. The biggest determinants of poverty may lie beyond the reach of RCTs
- **Ethics**: Withholding a potentially beneficial intervention from a control group raises moral questions — even if the evidence produced saves more lives in the long run

Despite these limitations, the experimental approach brought something that development economics desperately needed: **discipline**. Before Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer, too much policy was based on ideology, anecdote, or the preferences of donors. After them, the standard is evidence.

Their 2019 Nobel Prize was awarded "for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty." Duflo, at 46, was the youngest-ever recipient of the economics Nobel and only the second woman to win (after Elinor Ostrom in 2009).

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you're a doctor and lots of kids are sick, but you don't know why. You could guess — maybe they need vitamins, maybe they need exercise, maybe they need cleaner water. But guessing wastes time and money. So instead, you try one thing at a time: give vitamins to half the kids and not to the other half, and see who gets better. Then try clean water the same way. Then exercise. That's what Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer did with poverty. Instead of arguing about big ideas like "should we give poor countries more money?", they tested small, specific things — like giving free bed nets to stop malaria, or offering a bag of lentils to parents who bring their kids for shots. They found that often the cheapest, simplest solutions worked best — but you'd never know without actually testing. Their experiments helped over 400 million people get access to programs that were proven to work.

## 善意的问题

几十年来，发展经济学被宏大理论和宏大辩论所主导。穷国应该关注自由市场还是国家计划？援助还是贸易？教育还是基础设施？数十亿美元取决于这些争论——但没有人在检验答案。

与此同时，在实地，贫困顽固地持续着。超过7亿人每天生活费不到1.90美元。贫穷国家的儿童死于花几分钱就能预防的疾病。学校建好了但教师不来。诊所有了药品但病人不来。显然有什么地方不对——但是什么？

班纳吉、迪弗洛和克雷默提出了一个激进的想法：**停止辩论宏大理论，开始做实验。** 从医学借鉴随机对照试验，应用于发展项目，让证据决定什么有效。他们的方法不仅提供了更好的答案——还改变了发展经济学家提出的问题。

---

## 克雷默：肯尼亚的先驱

1990年代中期，克雷默在肯尼亚西部工作，试图弄清楚为什么贫穷国家的学校表现如此糟糕。传统智慧有很多答案——教科书太少、教师太少、资金太少。但哪一个最重要？

克雷默做了发展经济学家很少做的事情：他**做了一个实验**。与一家荷兰非政府组织合作，他随机分配学校接受不同的干预——免费教科书、翻转图表、额外教师——并衡量结果。

发现令人惊讶且发人深省：

- **免费教科书没有帮助**——至少对普通学生没有。教科书是为最好的学生编写的，让大多数学生落后
- **翻转图表也没有帮助**
- **什么有帮助？** 治疗儿童肠道寄生虫。驱虫便宜（每个孩子每年约50美分），大幅改善了出勤率，并对附近未接受治疗的儿童有溢出效益

这一个实验推翻了多年的假设。它表明教育的约束瓶颈不是任何人预期的——而是健康。它展示了严格实验揭示理论和直觉遗漏的意外发现的力量。

## 班纳吉和迪弗洛：推广方法

班纳吉和迪弗洛都在MIT，他们将克雷默的实验方法发展为一个系统性研究计划，涵盖数十个国家的教育、健康、农业、信贷和治理。

他们的核心洞见：**贫困不是一个大问题——而是许多小问题。** 每个小问题都可以用精心设计的实验来研究。

**RCT在发展领域如何运作**：

- 确定一个具体干预——比如提供免费蚊帐预防疟疾
- 将社区随机分为处理组（获得蚊帐）和对照组（暂时不获得）
- 在设定期间后衡量两组的结果
- 结果差异就是干预的因果效应——不受选择偏差、预先存在的差异或一厢情愿的污染

**实验的关键发现**：

- **免疫接种**：在印度村庄，在免疫接种点提供小激励（一袋扁豆）将儿童免疫接种率从6%提高到38%。问题不是无知或反对——而是在特定日子去遥远诊所的麻烦
- **教育**：雇用额外的助教帮助落后学生比减少班级规模或提供更多教科书更能提高考试成绩。问题不是资源——而是教学没有针对学生的实际水平
- **小额信贷**：向穷人提供小额贷款被广泛赞誉为消除贫困的灵丹妙药。严格的RCT显示现实更为温和：小额信贷帮助一些人创办小企业，但没有产生倡导者声称的变革性效果。没有万能药
- **储蓄**：穷人经常不储蓄——不是因为他们不想，而是因为储蓄不方便，花钱的诱惑无处不在。简单的助推——标记储蓄账户、承诺机制、自动存款——显著提高了储蓄率
- **农业**：肯尼亚农民知道化肥能增加产量但仍不使用。为什么？不是无知，而是拖延。在收获时（农民有现金时）提供小折扣比后来提供更大补贴更能大幅提高化肥使用率

## J-PAL：证据的基础设施

2003年，班纳吉、迪弗洛和穆莱纳坦在MIT创立了**阿卜杜勒·拉提夫·贾米尔贫困行动实验室（J-PAL）**——一个致力于运行和协调发展经济学RCT的研究中心。

J-PAL改变了这个领域：

- 一个由近200名附属研究人员组成的网络，在80多个国家进行了超过1000项RCT
- 经J-PAL证据验证的项目已扩大到覆盖全球超过4亿人
- 印度、印度尼西亚、秘鲁和数十个其他国家的政府现在使用RCT证据来设计政策
- J-PAL创建了一个"循证政策"模式，影响远超经济学领域

克雷默还帮助创立了美国国际开发署的**发展创新风险投资**项目和**全球创新基金**，创建了将成功干预从实验室推广到政策的管道。

## 实验揭示的贫困真相

除了任何单一发现，实验方法揭示了穷人如何做决策的深层模式：

- **穷人是理性的但受约束的**：鉴于他们的处境，他们做出合理的选择——但这些处境包括持续的压力、有限的信息和零容错空间。一次糟糕的收成或一个生病的孩子可以毁掉多年的进步
- **小障碍有巨大影响**：即使对蚊帐、驱虫药或净水滴剂收取很小的费用也会大幅降低使用率。免费分发效果好得多——不是因为穷人负担不起几分钱，而是因为当你被日常生存压倒时，任何摩擦点都成为不行动的借口
- **默认设置对穷人和富人同样重要**：正如塞勒的助推在富裕国家有效，默认注册、自动提醒和简化程序在贫穷国家也大幅改善了结果
- **情境就是一切**：在肯尼亚有效的干预在印度可能失败。对女性有效的项目对男性可能无效。RCT迫使谦逊——唯一知道的方法是测试

## 实验的局限

实验方法强大但并非没有限制。批评者提出了重要关切：

- **外部有效性**：一个村庄的结果能推广到整个国家吗？到另一个国家？将小实验扩大规模可能完全改变动态
- **大问题难以随机化**：你可以随机化蚊帐，但不能随机化贸易政策、制度或政治体系。贫困的最大决定因素可能超出RCT的范围
- **伦理**：对对照组扣留可能有益的干预引发道德问题——即使产生的证据从长远来看能拯救更多生命

尽管存在这些局限，实验方法带来了发展经济学迫切需要的东西：**纪律**。在班纳吉、迪弗洛和克雷默之前，太多政策基于意识形态、轶事或捐助者的偏好。在他们之后，标准是证据。

他们2019年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其减轻全球贫困的实验性方法。" 迪弗洛46岁时成为经济学诺贝尔奖最年轻的获奖者，也是第二位获奖女性（继2009年的奥斯特罗姆之后）。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你是一个医生，很多孩子生病了，但你不知道为什么。你可以猜——也许他们需要维生素，也许需要锻炼，也许需要更干净的水。但猜测浪费时间和金钱。所以你一次试一件事：给一半孩子维生素，另一半不给，看谁好转。然后用同样的方式试干净的水。然后锻炼。班纳吉、迪弗洛和克雷默对贫困做了同样的事。他们不争论"我们应该给穷国更多钱吗？"这样的大问题，而是测试小的、具体的事情——比如发放免费蚊帐阻止疟疾，或者给带孩子打疫苗的父母提供一袋扁豆。他们发现最便宜、最简单的解决方案往往效果最好——但不实际测试你永远不会知道。他们的实验帮助超过4亿人获得了经证明有效的项目。
