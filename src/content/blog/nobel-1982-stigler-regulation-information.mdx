## When the Watchdog Becomes the Pet

Why do governments regulate industries? The textbook answer: to protect the public from monopoly power, pollution, and fraud. George Stigler asked a more uncomfortable question: who actually benefits from regulation? His answer shook the foundations of public policy — regulation is typically acquired by the industry and designed to serve its interests, not the public's. The watchdog doesn't guard the sheep; it gets adopted by the wolves.

This was just one of Stigler's contributions. Across a career spanning five decades at the University of Chicago, he transformed three fields: industrial organization (how markets actually work), the economics of information (why prices differ and how people search), and the economics of regulation (why government intervention often fails).

## The Economics of Information: Why Prices Differ

Before Stigler, economists assumed that buyers and sellers have perfect information — everyone knows every price. But walk into any city and you'll find the same product at wildly different prices. Why?

In his groundbreaking 1961 paper *The Economics of Information*, Stigler provided the answer: **information is costly to acquire**. Searching for the best price takes time and effort. Rational consumers don't search until they find the absolute lowest price — they search until the expected benefit of one more search falls below its cost.

Key implications:

- **Price dispersion is natural**: Even in competitive markets, identical goods sell at different prices because search is costly. This isn't a market failure — it's a market reality
- **Advertising can improve efficiency**: By reducing search costs, advertising helps consumers find better deals. It's not just persuasion — it's information
- **Reputation matters**: When quality is hard to observe before purchase, consumers rely on brand reputation as a shortcut — a form of economizing on information costs

This paper launched the entire field of search theory and information economics — later developed by Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz into a Nobel-winning body of work on asymmetric information.

## Industrial Organization: How Markets Really Work

Stigler brought empirical rigor to the study of market structure — moving beyond abstract models to examine how real industries actually behave.

His contributions reshaped the field:

- **Economies of scale and the survivor technique** (1958): Instead of theorizing about optimal firm size, Stigler proposed a simple empirical test — look at which firm sizes survive and grow over time. If small firms keep disappearing and large firms keep growing, there are economies of scale. If firms of all sizes coexist, the cost curve is flat. Let the market reveal the answer
- **The theory of oligopoly** (1964): Analyzed how firms in concentrated industries coordinate pricing without explicit collusion. Stigler showed that cartels are inherently unstable because each member has an incentive to cheat — and that the ability to detect cheating depends on market structure. More buyers, more secret deals, more product heterogeneity all make collusion harder to sustain
- **Barriers to entry**: Stigler defined a barrier to entry as a cost that must be borne by new entrants but not by incumbents — a much narrower definition than previously used. This shifted the debate: many supposed "barriers" (like advertising or capital requirements) are simply costs of doing business, not anticompetitive obstacles
- **The measurement of concentration**: Developed methods to measure market concentration and its relationship to profitability, providing the empirical foundation for antitrust policy

## The Theory of Economic Regulation: Capture

Stigler's most influential and controversial contribution came in his 1971 paper *The Theory of Economic Regulation*. He turned the traditional view of regulation on its head:

**The traditional view**: Regulation exists to correct market failures — monopoly, externalities, information asymmetries. It serves the public interest.

**Stigler's view**: Regulation is a product supplied by politicians and demanded by interest groups. Industries seek regulation because it can:

- **Restrict entry**: Licensing requirements keep out competitors
- **Suppress substitutes**: Regulations can disadvantage alternative products
- **Fix prices**: Rate-setting prevents price competition
- **Provide subsidies**: Direct or indirect transfers from taxpayers to the industry

The industry has concentrated interests and resources to lobby effectively. The public's interest is diffuse — each consumer loses a little, so no one fights hard. The result: **regulatory capture** — the regulated industry controls the regulator.

Examples abound: taxi medallion systems that protect incumbents from ride-sharing, agricultural subsidies that benefit large farms, financial regulations written by the banks they're supposed to constrain. Stigler didn't just theorize — he documented these patterns empirically across industries.

## The Chicago School Approach

Stigler was a central figure in the Chicago School of economics, alongside Milton Friedman and Ronald Coase. Their shared approach:

- Trust markets more than government — markets have self-correcting mechanisms that regulation often lacks
- Demand empirical evidence — don't assume market failure, measure it
- Analyze incentives — people and institutions respond to incentives, including regulators
- Be skeptical of good intentions — policies should be judged by their results, not their stated goals

His 1982 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his seminal studies of industrial structures, functioning of markets and causes and effects of public regulation."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine your school hires a hall monitor to make sure the big kids don't bully the little kids. But what if the big kids give the monitor candy every day? Pretty soon, the monitor starts looking the other way when the big kids cut in line. That's what Stigler discovered about government regulation — the companies being watched often end up controlling the watchers. He also figured out why the same toy costs different prices at different stores: because it takes time and effort to check every store, and your time is worth something too.

## 当看门狗变成了宠物

政府为什么要监管行业？教科书的答案是：保护公众免受垄断、污染和欺诈。斯蒂格勒提出了一个更令人不安的问题：监管实际上让谁受益？他的答案动摇了公共政策的根基——监管通常是由行业获取的，其设计和运作主要服务于行业利益，而非公众利益。看门狗不是在守护羊群，而是被狼收养了。

这只是斯蒂格勒贡献的一部分。在芝加哥大学长达五十年的学术生涯中，他改变了三个领域：产业组织（市场实际如何运作）、信息经济学（为什么价格不同以及人们如何搜索）和监管经济学（为什么政府干预往往失败）。

---

## 信息经济学：为什么价格不同

在斯蒂格勒之前，经济学家假设买卖双方拥有完全信息——每个人都知道每一个价格。但走进任何一座城市，你会发现同一种产品的价格差异巨大。为什么？

在1961年开创性的论文《信息经济学》中，斯蒂格勒给出了答案：**获取信息是有成本的**。搜索最优价格需要时间和精力。理性的消费者不会搜索到找到绝对最低价——他们搜索到再多搜一次的预期收益低于其成本时就停止。

关键含义：

- **价格离散是自然的**：即使在竞争市场中，相同商品也以不同价格出售，因为搜索是有成本的。这不是市场失灵——这是市场现实
- **广告可以提高效率**：通过降低搜索成本，广告帮助消费者找到更好的交易。它不仅仅是说服——它是信息
- **声誉很重要**：当质量在购买前难以观察时，消费者依赖品牌声誉作为捷径——一种节约信息成本的方式

这篇论文开创了整个搜索理论和信息经济学领域——后来被阿克洛夫、斯彭斯和斯蒂格利茨发展为关于信息不对称的诺贝尔奖级研究。

## 产业组织：市场真正如何运作

斯蒂格勒为市场结构研究带来了实证严谨性——超越抽象模型，考察真实行业的实际行为。

他的贡献重塑了这一领域：

- **规模经济与生存者技术**（1958年）：斯蒂格勒不是理论推导最优企业规模，而是提出一个简单的实证检验——观察哪些规模的企业随时间存活和增长。如果小企业不断消失、大企业不断增长，就存在规模经济。如果各种规模的企业共存，成本曲线是平坦的。让市场揭示答案
- **寡头垄断理论**（1964年）：分析了集中行业中的企业如何在没有明确串谋的情况下协调定价。斯蒂格勒证明卡特尔本质上是不稳定的，因为每个成员都有作弊的激励——而发现作弊的能力取决于市场结构
- **进入壁垒**：斯蒂格勒将进入壁垒定义为新进入者必须承担但在位者不必承担的成本——比以前使用的定义窄得多。许多所谓的"壁垒"只是经营成本，而非反竞争障碍
- **集中度测量**：开发了衡量市场集中度及其与盈利能力关系的方法，为反垄断政策提供了实证基础

## 经济监管理论：俘获

斯蒂格勒最有影响力也最具争议的贡献来自1971年的论文《经济监管理论》。他将传统的监管观念彻底颠覆：

**传统观点**：监管的存在是为了纠正市场失灵——垄断、外部性、信息不对称。它服务于公共利益。

**斯蒂格勒的观点**：监管是由政客供给、由利益集团需求的产品。行业寻求监管，因为监管可以：

- **限制进入**：许可证要求将竞争者拒之门外
- **压制替代品**：法规可以使替代产品处于不利地位
- **固定价格**：费率设定阻止价格竞争
- **提供补贴**：从纳税人到行业的直接或间接转移

行业有集中的利益和资源来有效游说。公众的利益是分散的——每个消费者只损失一点点，所以没人会拼命抗争。结果就是：**监管俘获**——被监管的行业控制了监管者。

例子比比皆是：保护在位者免受网约车竞争的出租车牌照制度、惠及大型农场的农业补贴、由本应受其约束的银行参与起草的金融法规。斯蒂格勒不仅仅是理论推演——他在各行业中实证记录了这些模式。

## 芝加哥学派的方法

斯蒂格勒是芝加哥经济学派的核心人物，与弗里德曼和科斯并肩。他们共同的方法论：

- 信任市场多于信任政府——市场有自我纠正机制，而监管往往缺乏
- 要求实证证据——不要假设市场失灵，要去测量它
- 分析激励——人和机构都对激励做出反应，包括监管者
- 对良好意图保持怀疑——政策应以结果而非声明的目标来评判

他1982年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对产业结构、市场运作机制以及公共管制的原因与影响的开创性研究。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你的学校雇了一个走廊巡查员，确保大孩子不欺负小孩子。但如果大孩子每天给巡查员糖果呢？很快，巡查员就会在大孩子插队时视而不见。这就是斯蒂格勒发现的政府监管的真相——被监管的公司往往最终控制了监管者。他还弄清楚了为什么同一个玩具在不同商店价格不同：因为逐店比价需要时间和精力，而你的时间也是有价值的。
