## The Problem of Cause and Effect

Economics is full of questions that sound simple but are fiendishly hard to answer:

- Does raising the minimum wage destroy jobs?
- Does immigration lower wages for native workers?
- Does an extra year of school increase your earnings?

The difficulty isn't a lack of data — it's that **correlation isn't causation**. States with higher minimum wages may have stronger economies to begin with. Cities with more immigrants may be more dynamic. People who stay in school longer may be more motivated regardless. The real cause hides behind a tangle of confounding factors.

The gold standard for establishing causation is a randomized experiment — like the RCTs that won Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer their 2019 Nobel. But you can't randomly assign minimum wages to states, or randomly send immigrants to cities, or randomly force teenagers to stay in school. Many of the most important economic questions are ones where experiments are impossible.

The 2021 Nobel honored three economists who found another way. David Card showed that **nature sometimes runs the experiment for us** — policy changes, historical accidents, and geographic boundaries create situations that mimic random assignment. Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens built the rigorous statistical framework for extracting causal conclusions from these "natural experiments" — and for knowing exactly how far those conclusions extend.

Together, they launched what became known as the **credibility revolution** in economics.

## Card: Overturning Conventional Wisdom

David Card's genius was spotting situations where real-world events created something close to a controlled experiment — and then using them to challenge beliefs that economists had held for decades.

**The minimum wage study that shocked the profession**

For generations, economists overwhelmingly agreed: raise the minimum wage, and employers will hire fewer workers. It was textbook economics — higher labor costs mean less labor demanded. The only debate was how big the job losses would be.

In 1992, Card and his colleague Alan Krueger (who died in 2019 and would likely have shared the Nobel) noticed a natural experiment unfolding. New Jersey raised its minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05. Neighboring Pennsylvania didn't. The two states had similar economies and similar fast-food industries. This was as close to a controlled experiment as you could get.

Card and Krueger surveyed fast-food restaurants on both sides of the border, before and after the increase. Their finding: **employment in New Jersey's fast-food sector didn't fall — it actually rose slightly** relative to Pennsylvania.

The result was explosive. It didn't just question the magnitude of job losses from minimum wages — it questioned whether they existed at all. The study prompted enormous debate and extensive follow-up research. The emerging consensus: moderate minimum wage increases have surprisingly small effects on employment, for several reasons:

- Companies can pass costs to customers through small price increases
- In areas where one employer dominates (monopsony), wages were already below market-clearing levels, so the minimum wage actually pushes employment closer to efficient levels
- Higher wages reduce turnover, saving on hiring and training costs
- Higher wages can increase worker productivity through efficiency wages

**The Mariel Boatlift: Immigration doesn't do what you think**

In 1980, Fidel Castro suddenly allowed Cubans to leave. Within months, 125,000 Cubans emigrated to the United States, with most settling in Miami. The city's labor force grew by 7% virtually overnight — a massive and completely unexpected shock.

Card compared Miami's labor market to four similar cities that didn't receive the influx. If immigration depresses wages and takes jobs from natives, Miami should have been devastated. The result: **wages and employment for low-skilled workers in Miami were essentially unaffected**. The labor market absorbed the shock with little trace.

How? Immigrants create demand as well as supply — they buy food, rent apartments, use services. Industries expanded to serve the larger population. And immigrants often complement native workers rather than substitute for them — they take different jobs, work different hours, or bring different skills.

**Returns to education**

Do people earn more because they went to school longer — or do the same traits that keep kids in school (motivation, ability, family background) also lead to higher earnings? Card used natural experiments to separate cause from correlation:

- Differences in compulsory schooling laws across states and time periods created variation in how long people stayed in school — variation that had nothing to do with individual motivation
- Children who grew up near a college were more likely to attend — proximity as a source of random variation
- These natural experiments showed that the causal return to education was at least as large as — and possibly larger than — naive estimates suggested. Education wasn't just a signal of pre-existing ability; it genuinely increased earnings

## Angrist and Imbens: The Framework for Causal Inference

Card's natural experiments were powerful, but they raised a deeper question: **exactly what causal conclusions can we draw from them?**

A natural experiment isn't a true randomized trial. The variation it exploits (a policy change, a geographic boundary) affects some people more than others, and people respond differently. What precisely does the estimated effect represent?

**The problem of heterogeneity**

Imagine using Vietnam War draft lottery numbers as a natural experiment to study the effect of military service on earnings. The draft lottery randomly assigned numbers to young men — low numbers got drafted, high numbers didn't. This creates random variation in who serves.

But not everyone with a low number actually served (some got exemptions), and some with high numbers volunteered. The treatment group and control group aren't perfectly clean. Moreover, the people who **would** serve regardless of their number (volunteers) might be very different from people who **only** serve because they were drafted. The effect of service might be different for each group.

**The LATE theorem**

In their landmark 1994 paper, Angrist and Imbens solved this problem with elegant precision. They showed that a natural experiment with an **instrumental variable** (like the draft lottery number) identifies a specific causal effect: the **Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)** — the causal effect for **compliers**, the people whose behavior was actually changed by the instrument.

In the draft example:
- **Always-takers**: Would serve regardless of their draft number (volunteers). The instrument doesn't affect them
- **Never-takers**: Would never serve regardless of their draft number (got exemptions). The instrument doesn't affect them either
- **Compliers**: Served because they got a low number, and wouldn't have served otherwise. **The LATE measures the effect of military service specifically for this group**

This was a profound clarification. It meant:

- **Honesty about what you've measured**: The LATE doesn't tell you the effect for everyone — it tells you the effect for the people whose behavior the instrument actually changed. This is a narrower but much more credible claim
- **Transparent assumptions**: Angrist and Imbens made explicit the assumptions needed for the instrument to work — assumptions that could be scrutinized, debated, and tested
- **A bridge between economics and statistics**: Their potential outcomes framework merged the instrumental variables tradition from economics with the causal inference framework from statistics, creating a common language for both fields

**Beyond LATE**

The Angrist-Imbens framework gave empirical researchers a rigorous protocol:

1. Find a natural experiment that creates plausibly random variation
2. Identify the instrumental variable — the source of this variation
3. State your assumptions explicitly
4. Estimate the LATE — the causal effect for compliers
5. Be transparent about the limitations — who the result applies to and who it doesn't

This protocol became the standard for empirical work across all of economics — and increasingly in political science, sociology, epidemiology, and other fields.

## The Credibility Revolution

Before Card, Angrist, and Imbens, much of empirical economics relied on statistical models with strong assumptions that were difficult to verify. Researchers would run regressions, "control" for confounding variables, and claim causal relationships — but the results were only as good as the assumptions, which were often questionable.

The credibility revolution changed the culture:

- **Research design first**: Instead of building elaborate statistical models, identify a source of plausibly random variation — a natural experiment — and let the design do the work
- **Transparency over sophistication**: A simple comparison across a policy boundary is often more convincing than a complex model with dozens of control variables
- **Humility about scope**: The LATE framework taught researchers to be honest about what their evidence shows — not overclaiming universal effects from local evidence
- **Replicability**: Natural experiments can be re-examined by other researchers using the same data and design, making results more robust to scrutiny

The revolution spread far beyond the topics Card originally studied. Today, researchers use natural experiments to study the effects of policing on crime, air pollution on health, social media on political behavior, and hundreds of other questions where randomized experiments are impossible.

The 2021 Nobel Prize was awarded to Card "for his empirical contributions to labour economics" and to Angrist and Imbens "for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you want to know if eating breakfast makes kids do better on tests. You can't just compare breakfast-eaters to breakfast-skippers, because maybe the kids who eat breakfast also have parents who help them study. You need a trick. What if one day, a snowstorm closes half the roads, so some kids can't get to the cafeteria for breakfast and others can — and it's basically random who lives on which road? Now you can compare the two groups fairly, because the snowstorm decided who ate breakfast, not the kids or their parents. That's a "natural experiment." Card found situations like this in real life — like when one state raised its minimum wage and the neighboring state didn't — and used them to discover surprising things, like that raising the minimum wage didn't actually cost jobs. Angrist and Imbens figured out the math for exactly what you can learn from these natural experiments, and what you can't. Together, they taught economists to stop guessing about what causes what and start looking for situations where life accidentally runs the experiment for them.

## 因果关系的问题

经济学充满了听起来简单但极难回答的问题：

- 提高最低工资会摧毁就业吗？
- 移民会降低本地工人的工资吗？
- 多上一年学会增加你的收入吗？

困难不在于缺乏数据——而在于**相关性不等于因果性**。最低工资较高的州可能本身经济就更强。移民更多的城市可能更有活力。在学校待更久的人可能本来就更有动力。真正的原因隐藏在一团混杂因素之后。

建立因果关系的黄金标准是随机实验——就像赢得班纳吉、迪弗洛和克雷默2019年诺贝尔奖的RCT。但你不能随机给各州分配最低工资，不能随机把移民送到各城市，也不能随机强迫青少年留在学校。许多最重要的经济学问题恰恰是不可能做实验的。

2021年诺贝尔奖表彰了找到另一种方法的三位经济学家。卡德证明**自然有时会替我们做实验**——政策变化、历史偶然和地理边界创造出类似随机分配的情境。安格里斯特和因本斯构建了从这些"自然实验"中提取因果结论的严格统计框架——并精确界定这些结论的适用范围。

他们共同开启了经济学中所谓的**可信性革命**。

## 卡德：推翻传统智慧

卡德的天才在于发现现实世界事件创造出接近受控实验的情境——然后利用它们挑战经济学家持有数十年的信念。

**震惊学界的最低工资研究**

几代人以来，经济学家压倒性地同意：提高最低工资，雇主会雇用更少的工人。这是教科书经济学——更高的劳动成本意味着更少的劳动需求。唯一的辩论是就业损失有多大。

1992年，卡德和他的同事克鲁格（2019年去世，很可能会分享诺贝尔奖）注意到一个正在展开的自然实验。新泽西州将最低工资从4.25美元提高到5.05美元。邻近的宾夕法尼亚州没有。两个州有相似的经济和相似的快餐业。这是你能得到的最接近受控实验的情况。

卡德和克鲁格在增加前后调查了边界两侧的快餐店。他们的发现：**新泽西快餐业的就业没有下降——相对于宾夕法尼亚实际上略有上升**。

结果是爆炸性的。它不仅质疑最低工资带来的就业损失的幅度——还质疑它们是否存在。这项研究引发了巨大辩论和广泛的后续研究。形成的共识是：适度的最低工资提高对就业的影响出人意料地小，原因有几个：

- 企业可以通过小幅提价将成本转嫁给消费者
- 在一个雇主占主导地位的地区（买方垄断），工资已经低于市场出清水平，所以最低工资实际上将就业推向更有效率的水平
- 更高的工资减少人员流动，节省招聘和培训成本
- 更高的工资可以通过效率工资提高工人生产力

**马列尔偷渡事件：移民不是你想的那样**

1980年，卡斯特罗突然允许古巴人离开。几个月内，12.5万古巴人移民到美国，大多数定居在迈阿密。该市劳动力几乎在一夜之间增长了7%——一个巨大且完全出乎意料的冲击。

卡德将迈阿密的劳动力市场与四个没有接受大量移民的类似城市进行比较。如果移民压低工资并抢走本地人的工作，迈阿密应该遭到重创。结果：**迈阿密低技能工人的工资和就业基本没有受到影响**。劳动力市场几乎无痕地吸收了这一冲击。

怎么做到的？移民既创造需求也创造供给——他们买食物、租公寓、使用服务。行业扩张以服务更大的人口。移民往往与本地工人互补而非替代——他们从事不同的工作、工作不同的时间、或带来不同的技能。

**教育回报**

人们赚更多是因为他们上学更久——还是让孩子留在学校的同样特质（动机、能力、家庭背景）也导致了更高的收入？卡德使用自然实验将因果与相关分离：

- 各州和各时期义务教育法律的差异创造了人们在学校待多久的变异——这种变异与个人动机无关
- 住在大学附近的孩子更可能上大学——邻近性作为随机变异的来源
- 这些自然实验表明教育的因果回报至少与——可能大于——朴素估计所显示的一样大。教育不仅仅是预先存在能力的信号；它真正增加了收入

## 安格里斯特和因本斯：因果推断的框架

卡德的自然实验很强大，但它们提出了一个更深层的问题：**我们究竟能从中得出什么因果结论？**

自然实验不是真正的随机试验。它利用的变异（政策变化、地理边界）对不同人影响不同，人们的反应也不同。估计的效应究竟代表什么？

**异质性问题**

想象使用越战征兵抽签号码作为自然实验来研究服兵役对收入的影响。征兵抽签随机给年轻人分配号码——号码小的被征召，号码大的不被征召。这创造了谁服役的随机变异。

但不是每个号码小的人都实际服役（有些人得到豁免），一些号码大的人自愿参军。处理组和对照组并不完全干净。此外，**无论号码如何都会**服役的人（志愿者）可能与**只因被征召才**服役的人非常不同。服役的效应对每组可能不同。

**LATE定理**

在他们1994年的里程碑论文中，安格里斯特和因本斯以优雅的精确性解决了这个问题。他们证明了带有**工具变量**（如征兵抽签号码）的自然实验识别一个特定的因果效应：**局部平均处理效应（LATE）**——对**顺从者**的因果效应，即那些行为实际被工具改变的人。

在征兵例子中：
- **总是接受者**：无论征兵号码如何都会服役（志愿者）。工具不影响他们
- **从不接受者**：无论征兵号码如何都不会服役（得到豁免）。工具也不影响他们
- **顺从者**：因为得到小号码而服役，否则不会服役。**LATE衡量的是专门针对这组人的兵役效应**

这是一个深刻的澄清。它意味着：

- **对你衡量了什么的诚实**：LATE不告诉你对所有人的效应——它告诉你对那些行为实际被工具改变的人的效应。这是一个更窄但更可信的主张
- **透明的假设**：安格里斯特和因本斯明确了工具发挥作用所需的假设——这些假设可以被审查、辩论和检验
- **经济学与统计学之间的桥梁**：他们的潜在结果框架将经济学的工具变量传统与统计学的因果推断框架合并，为两个领域创造了共同语言

**超越LATE**

安格里斯特-因本斯框架给实证研究者提供了一个严格的协议：

1. 找到一个创造似乎随机变异的自然实验
2. 识别工具变量——这种变异的来源
3. 明确陈述你的假设
4. 估计LATE——对顺从者的因果效应
5. 对局限性保持透明——结果适用于谁、不适用于谁

这个协议成为整个经济学实证工作的标准——并且越来越多地应用于政治学、社会学、流行病学和其他领域。

## 可信性革命

在卡德、安格里斯特和因本斯之前，许多实证经济学依赖于具有难以验证的强假设的统计模型。研究者运行回归、"控制"混杂变量、并声称因果关系——但结果只和假设一样好，而假设往往是可疑的。

可信性革命改变了文化：

- **研究设计优先**：不是建立精细的统计模型，而是识别一个似乎随机的变异来源——自然实验——让设计来做工作
- **透明胜于复杂**：跨政策边界的简单比较往往比有几十个控制变量的复杂模型更有说服力
- **对范围保持谦逊**：LATE框架教会研究者对他们的证据显示什么保持诚实——不从局部证据过度主张普遍效应
- **可复制性**：自然实验可以被其他研究者用同样的数据和设计重新检验，使结果更经得起审查

革命远远超出了卡德最初研究的主题。今天，研究者使用自然实验研究警务对犯罪的影响、空气污染对健康的影响、社交媒体对政治行为的影响，以及数百个不可能进行随机实验的其他问题。

2021年诺贝尔奖授予卡德"因其对劳动经济学的实证贡献"，授予安格里斯特和因本斯"因其对因果关系分析的方法论贡献"。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你想知道吃早餐是否让孩子考试更好。你不能只比较吃早餐的和不吃的，因为也许吃早餐的孩子的父母也帮他们学习。你需要一个窍门。如果有一天，暴风雪封了一半的路，一些孩子到不了食堂吃早餐而其他人可以——而住在哪条路上基本上是随机的呢？现在你可以公平地比较两组了，因为是暴风雪决定了谁吃早餐，而不是孩子或他们的父母。这就是"自然实验"。卡德在现实生活中找到了这样的情境——比如一个州提高了最低工资而邻州没有——并用它们发现了令人惊讶的事情，比如提高最低工资实际上没有减少就业。安格里斯特和因本斯弄清了你能从这些自然实验中准确学到什么、不能学到什么的数学。他们一起教会经济学家停止猜测什么导致什么，开始寻找生活意外替你做实验的情境。
