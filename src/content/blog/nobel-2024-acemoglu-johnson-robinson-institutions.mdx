## The Most Important Question in Economics

Why is Norway 70 times richer per capita than Niger? Why is South Korea a technological powerhouse while North Korea starves? Why did Western Europe pull ahead of the rest of the world, and why did some former European colonies become wealthy democracies while others remained trapped in poverty?

This is the central question of development economics — and for centuries, the answers pointed to geography (tropical climates make people poor), culture (some societies value hard work more), or resources (countries with oil get rich). These answers are intuitive. They are also, as the 2024 Nobel laureates demonstrated, largely wrong.

Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson showed that the fundamental driver of long-run prosperity is **institutions** — the rules, laws, norms, and organizations that structure economic and political life. Countries with **inclusive institutions** that protect property rights, enforce contracts, provide public goods, and allow broad participation in economic and political life become rich. Countries with **extractive institutions** that concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few remain poor — no matter how favorable their geography or abundant their resources.

Their evidence came from an unexpected source: the history of European colonialism.

## The Colonial Natural Experiment

How do you prove that institutions cause prosperity, rather than the other way around? Rich countries might develop good institutions because they can afford them. You need a way to isolate the causal effect of institutions — and that requires a natural experiment.

Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson found one in colonial history.

**The key insight**: Europeans colonized different parts of the world in radically different ways, and these different colonization strategies created radically different institutions — differences that persist to this day.

**Where Europeans could settle, they built inclusive institutions**:

- In places with temperate climates and low disease burdens — North America, Australia, New Zealand — large numbers of Europeans settled permanently
- Settlers demanded the same rights they had at home: property rights, rule of law, political representation, constraints on government power
- These **inclusive institutions** created incentives for investment, innovation, and broad-based economic participation
- Over centuries, these institutions generated sustained economic growth

**Where Europeans couldn't settle, they built extractive institutions**:

- In places with tropical diseases — much of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Central America and Southeast Asia — European mortality rates were devastating. Settlers couldn't survive in large numbers
- Instead, Europeans set up **extractive institutions**: forced labor systems, plantation economies, mining operations designed to extract resources and ship them back to Europe
- Power was concentrated in a tiny colonial elite. Property rights existed only for the rulers. The majority population had no economic or political rights
- After independence, local elites inherited these extractive structures and had every incentive to maintain them

**The instrument**: Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson used **European settler mortality rates** as an instrumental variable. Where mortality was high, Europeans couldn't settle, so they built extractive institutions. Where mortality was low, they settled and built inclusive institutions. Because mortality rates were determined by disease environments — not by the indigenous economy — they provide a clean source of variation in institutional quality.

The result: even after controlling for geography, climate, religion, culture, and every other factor, **institutions explain the vast majority of the income differences across former colonies**.

## The Reversal of Fortune

The most striking evidence for their theory is what they called the **reversal of fortune**.

Among countries colonized by Europeans, **the places that were richest in 1500 are now among the poorest, and vice versa**.

- The Aztec and Inca empires were among the most advanced civilizations in the world in 1500, with large populations, sophisticated agriculture, and wealthy cities. Mexico and Peru are now middle-income countries
- The Mughal Empire in India presided over perhaps a quarter of global GDP. India today has a per capita income far below the world average
- North America and Australia in 1500 were sparsely populated with limited agriculture. They are now among the richest places on earth

Why the reversal? Because colonizers created **inclusive** institutions in places that were **poor** (where few indigenous people meant less to extract and more reason to build settlements with rights) and **extractive** institutions in places that were **rich** (where large populations could be coerced into forced labor and valuable resources could be plundered).

This reversal cannot be explained by geography (geography didn't change), culture (the same European colonizers created both types of institutions), or resources (resource-rich colonies often ended up poorer). Only institutions explain the pattern.

## Inclusive vs. Extractive: The Framework

Acemoglu and Robinson developed this framework most fully in their bestselling book *Why Nations Fail* (2012, translated into 49 languages):

**Inclusive economic institutions**:
- Secure property rights for the broad population — not just elites
- Enforce contracts impartially
- Allow and encourage entry of new businesses
- Provide public goods: education, infrastructure, rule of law
- Enable individuals to choose their own occupations and investments

**Inclusive political institutions**:
- Distribute political power broadly — pluralism
- Constrain executive power through checks and balances
- Allow peaceful transitions of power
- Give citizens voice through elections, free press, and civil society

**Extractive economic institutions**:
- Property rights exist only for the elite, or are insecure for everyone else
- Markets are rigged: monopolies, cartels, barriers to entry
- Forced labor, restricted occupational choice
- Public goods are provided to the elite only

**Extractive political institutions**:
- Power concentrated in a narrow elite — an autocrat, a junta, a party
- No checks on executive power
- No peaceful mechanism for change
- Dissent is suppressed

The critical insight: **economic and political institutions reinforce each other**. Extractive political institutions enable extractive economic institutions (the elite writes rules that benefit itself). Extractive economic institutions fund extractive political institutions (the elite uses its wealth to maintain power). This creates a vicious cycle — an **institutional trap** — that is extremely difficult to escape.

Conversely, inclusive institutions create a virtuous cycle: broad economic participation generates a prosperous middle class that demands political participation, which produces policies that further broaden economic opportunity.

## Why Bad Institutions Persist

If inclusive institutions produce prosperity and extractive institutions produce poverty, why don't all countries adopt inclusive institutions?

Because **the people in power benefit from extraction**. Reforming institutions would benefit society as a whole but harm the current elite. And the elite controls the political system — the very mechanism through which reform would have to occur.

This creates a **commitment problem**: the elite could promise to reform institutions, but once reform threatens their power, they have every incentive to renege. Citizens know this, so they don't trust promises of reform. The result is institutional stagnation — a poverty trap maintained by rational self-interest.

Change requires **critical junctures** — moments when the balance of power shifts enough to create an opening: a revolution, a war, a plague, an external shock. At these moments, institutions can be reshaped. But which direction they move — toward inclusion or deeper extraction — depends on the specific historical circumstances.

Examples of critical junctures:
- The **Black Death** (1348) killed so much of Europe's population that surviving peasants gained bargaining power, eventually breaking feudalism in Western Europe — but in Eastern Europe, the same shock led to harsher serfdom
- The **Glorious Revolution** (1688) in England constrained the monarchy and empowered Parliament, setting the stage for inclusive institutions and the Industrial Revolution
- The **Atlantic trade** enriched merchant classes in Western Europe, who demanded political rights — but in Africa, the same trade fueled the slave trade and empowered extractive elites

## The Korea Example

Perhaps the cleanest test of the theory is the Korean peninsula. In 1945, Korea was split into North and South along the 38th parallel — an arbitrary line drawn by foreign powers. Same geography. Same culture. Same history. Same ethnic composition. Same starting point.

- **South Korea** developed inclusive institutions: property rights, market competition, eventually democratic governance. It became one of the world's most prosperous nations
- **North Korea** developed maximally extractive institutions: total state control, no property rights, no political freedom. It became one of the world's poorest

The income gap between the two Koreas is now among the largest between any two neighboring countries on earth — a gap that can only be explained by institutions.

Their 2024 Nobel Prize was awarded "for studies of how institutions are formed and affect prosperity."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine two classrooms with the same students, same books, same building. In Classroom A, the teacher makes fair rules: everyone gets a turn, good work is rewarded, and students can pick their own projects. Kids work hard because they know their effort pays off. In Classroom B, the teacher's favorite students get all the prizes, they can copy others' work, and the rest of the students get punished if they complain. Kids in Classroom B stop trying — why bother if the game is rigged? Over time, Classroom A becomes amazing while Classroom B falls apart. That's what Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson discovered about countries. Countries with fair rules (they call them "inclusive institutions") — where everyone's property is protected, anyone can start a business, and the government serves all the people — become rich. Countries with unfair rules ("extractive institutions") — where a small group takes everything and everyone else has no rights — stay poor. They proved this by studying what happened when Europeans colonized different parts of the world: where they settled and built fair systems, those places became rich. Where they just grabbed resources and left unfair systems behind, those places stayed poor — even centuries later.

## 经济学中最重要的问题

为什么挪威的人均收入是尼日尔的70倍？为什么韩国是技术强国而朝鲜却在挨饿？为什么西欧领先于世界其他地区？为什么一些前欧洲殖民地成为富裕的民主国家，而另一些却困在贫困中？

这是发展经济学的核心问题——几个世纪以来，答案指向地理（热带气候使人贫穷）、文化（某些社会更重视勤劳）或资源（有石油的国家变富）。这些答案很直观。但正如2024年诺贝尔奖得主所证明的，它们在很大程度上是错误的。

阿西莫格鲁、约翰逊和罗宾逊证明，长期繁荣的根本驱动力是**制度**——构建经济和政治生活的规则、法律、规范和组织。拥有保护产权、执行合同、提供公共品、允许广泛参与经济和政治生活的**包容性制度**的国家变得富裕。拥有将权力和财富集中在少数人手中的**榨取性制度**的国家保持贫穷——无论其地理条件多么有利或资源多么丰富。

他们的证据来自一个意想不到的来源：欧洲殖民历史。

## 殖民自然实验

你如何证明制度导致繁荣，而非相反？富裕国家可能因为负担得起而发展出好制度。你需要一种方法来隔离制度的因果效应——这需要自然实验。

阿西莫格鲁、约翰逊和罗宾逊在殖民历史中找到了一个。

**核心洞见**：欧洲人以根本不同的方式殖民了世界不同地区，这些不同的殖民策略创造了根本不同的制度——差异持续至今。

**欧洲人能够定居的地方，他们建立了包容性制度**：

- 在气候温和、疾病负担低的地方——北美、澳大利亚、新西兰——大量欧洲人永久定居
- 定居者要求与在家乡相同的权利：产权、法治、政治代表权、对政府权力的约束
- 这些**包容性制度**创造了投资、创新和广泛经济参与的激励
- 经过几个世纪，这些制度产生了持续的经济增长

**欧洲人无法定居的地方，他们建立了榨取性制度**：

- 在热带疾病肆虐的地方——撒哈拉以南非洲大部分地区、中美洲和东南亚部分地区——欧洲人死亡率极高。定居者无法大量生存
- 相反，欧洲人建立了**榨取性制度**：强制劳动体系、种植园经济、旨在榨取资源并运回欧洲的采矿作业
- 权力集中在一小群殖民精英手中。只有统治者享有产权。大多数人口没有经济或政治权利
- 独立后，当地精英继承了这些榨取性结构，并有充分的激励维持它们

**工具变量**：阿西莫格鲁、约翰逊和罗宾逊使用**欧洲定居者死亡率**作为工具变量。死亡率高的地方，欧洲人无法定居，所以建立了榨取性制度。死亡率低的地方，他们定居并建立了包容性制度。因为死亡率由疾病环境决定——而非由当地经济决定——它们提供了制度质量的干净变异来源。

结果：即使控制了地理、气候、宗教、文化和所有其他因素，**制度解释了前殖民地之间收入差异的绝大部分**。

## 命运的逆转

他们理论最引人注目的证据是所谓的**命运逆转**。

在被欧洲人殖民的国家中，**1500年最富裕的地方现在最贫穷，反之亦然**。

- 阿兹特克和印加帝国在1500年是世界上最先进的文明之一，拥有大量人口、复杂的农业和富裕的城市。墨西哥和秘鲁现在是中等收入国家
- 印度的莫卧儿帝国掌控着可能是全球GDP的四分之一。今天印度的人均收入远低于世界平均水平
- 1500年的北美和澳大利亚人口稀少，农业有限。它们现在是地球上最富裕的地方

为什么逆转？因为殖民者在**贫穷**的地方创建了**包容性**制度（原住民少意味着可榨取的少，更有理由建设有权利的定居点），在**富裕**的地方创建了**榨取性**制度（大量人口可以被强迫劳动，宝贵资源可以被掠夺）。

这种逆转不能用地理解释（地理没有改变），不能用文化解释（同样的欧洲殖民者创建了两种制度），也不能用资源解释（资源丰富的殖民地往往最终更贫穷）。只有制度能解释这一模式。

## 包容性vs.榨取性：框架

阿西莫格鲁和罗宾逊在他们的畅销书《国家为什么会失败》（2012年，已翻译成49种语言）中最完整地发展了这一框架：

**包容性经济制度**：
- 为广大民众——而不仅仅是精英——提供安全的产权
- 公正地执行合同
- 允许和鼓励新企业进入
- 提供公共品：教育、基础设施、法治
- 使个人能够选择自己的职业和投资

**包容性政治制度**：
- 广泛分配政治权力——多元主义
- 通过制衡约束行政权力
- 允许权力的和平转移
- 通过选举、新闻自由和公民社会给予公民发言权

**榨取性经济制度**：
- 产权只存在于精英阶层，或对其他所有人不安全
- 市场被操纵：垄断、卡特尔、进入壁垒
- 强制劳动、限制职业选择
- 公共品仅提供给精英

**榨取性政治制度**：
- 权力集中在狭隘的精英手中——独裁者、军政府、政党
- 对行政权力没有制衡
- 没有和平的变革机制
- 异见被压制

关键洞见：**经济制度和政治制度相互强化**。榨取性政治制度使榨取性经济制度成为可能（精英制定有利于自己的规则）。榨取性经济制度资助榨取性政治制度（精英利用其财富维持权力）。这创造了一个恶性循环——**制度陷阱**——极难逃脱。

相反，包容性制度创造良性循环：广泛的经济参与产生繁荣的中产阶级，他们要求政治参与，这又产生进一步扩大经济机会的政策。

## 为什么坏制度持续存在

如果包容性制度产生繁荣而榨取性制度产生贫困，为什么不是所有国家都采用包容性制度？

因为**掌权者从榨取中获益**。改革制度会惠及整个社会但损害当前精英。而精英控制着政治系统——改革必须通过的那个机制。

这创造了**承诺问题**：精英可以承诺改革制度，但一旦改革威胁到他们的权力，他们就有充分的激励食言。公民知道这一点，所以不信任改革承诺。结果是制度停滞——一个由理性自利维持的贫困陷阱。

变革需要**关键节点**——权力平衡充分转变以创造开口的时刻：一场革命、一场战争、一场瘟疫、一次外部冲击。在这些时刻，制度可以被重塑。但它们向哪个方向移动——走向包容还是更深的榨取——取决于特定的历史情境。

关键节点的例子：
- **黑死病**（1348年）杀死了欧洲大量人口，幸存的农民获得了议价能力，最终打破了西欧的封建制度——但在东欧，同样的冲击导致了更严酷的农奴制
- 英格兰的**光荣革命**（1688年）约束了君主权力并赋予议会权力，为包容性制度和工业革命奠定了基础
- **大西洋贸易**使西欧商人阶层致富，他们要求政治权利——但在非洲，同样的贸易助长了奴隶贸易并强化了榨取性精英

## 朝鲜半岛的例子

也许对这一理论最干净的检验是朝鲜半岛。1945年，朝鲜沿三八线被分为南北——一条外国列强画出的任意线。相同的地理。相同的文化。相同的历史。相同的民族构成。相同的起点。

- **韩国**发展了包容性制度：产权、市场竞争、最终的民主治理。它成为世界上最繁荣的国家之一
- **朝鲜**发展了最大限度的榨取性制度：完全的国家控制、没有产权、没有政治自由。它成为世界上最贫穷的国家之一

两个朝鲜之间的收入差距现在是地球上任何两个邻国之间最大的差距之一——一个只能用制度来解释的差距。

他们2024年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对制度如何形成及影响繁荣的研究。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象两间教室，学生一样、课本一样、教室一样。在教室A，老师制定公平的规则：每个人都有机会，好的努力得到奖励，学生可以选择自己的项目。孩子们努力学习因为他们知道付出有回报。在教室B，老师最喜欢的学生得到所有的奖品，他们可以抄别人的作业，其他学生抱怨就会被惩罚。教室B的孩子们不再努力了——如果游戏是被操纵的，为什么要努力呢？随着时间推移，教室A变得很棒，教室B崩溃了。这就是阿西莫格鲁、约翰逊和罗宾逊关于国家的发现。有公平规则（他们称之为"包容性制度"）的国家——每个人的财产受保护、任何人都可以创业、政府为所有人服务——变得富裕。有不公平规则（"榨取性制度"）的国家——一小群人拿走一切而其他人没有权利——保持贫穷。他们通过研究欧洲人殖民世界不同地区时发生了什么来证明这一点：在他们定居并建立公平系统的地方，那些地方变得富裕。在他们只是掠夺资源并留下不公平系统的地方，那些地方保持贫穷——即使几个世纪之后。
