## Markets Without Prices

Not all markets use prices. You can't buy your way into a marriage. You can't purchase a kidney (legally). You can't bid for a spot at a public school. Yet these are all allocation problems — scarce resources must be matched to people who want them.

How do you design a system that produces good matches when money can't do the job? This is the problem of **matching markets**, and the 2012 Nobel Prize honored the theorist who solved it mathematically and the engineer who made it work in practice.

Lloyd Shapley, a mathematician, proved in 1962 that stable matchings always exist and designed an algorithm to find them. Alvin Roth, an economist, took Shapley's theory off the blackboard and into the real world — redesigning the systems that match doctors to hospitals, students to schools, and kidney donors to recipients.

## Shapley: The Theory of Stable Matching

In 1962, David Gale and Lloyd Shapley posed a deceptively simple question: can you always find a stable way to match men and women into couples?

A matching is **stable** if no two people would prefer to leave their current partners and match with each other instead. If such a pair exists, they have an incentive to break away — making the matching unstable.

The **Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm**:

1. Each man proposes to his top-choice woman
2. Each woman who receives multiple proposals keeps her favorite and rejects the rest
3. Rejected men propose to their next choice
4. The process repeats until everyone is matched

Gale and Shapley proved three remarkable results:

- **Existence**: The algorithm always terminates with a stable matching — no matter what the preferences are. A stable solution always exists
- **Optimality**: When men propose, the result is the best stable matching for men (and the worst for women). When women propose, the reverse. The proposing side gets the advantage
- **Strategy-proofness**: The proposing side has no incentive to misrepresent their preferences — honesty is the best strategy. But the receiving side might benefit from strategic behavior

These results were purely theoretical — Shapley was a mathematician interested in elegant proofs, not practical applications. It took Roth to see the real-world potential.

## Roth: From Theory to Life-Saving Practice

Alvin Roth made a remarkable discovery: the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), which had been matching medical graduates to hospital residencies since 1952, was essentially using the Gale-Shapley algorithm — without knowing it. The system had evolved toward stability through trial and error.

This insight launched Roth's career as an **economic engineer** — someone who designs real markets using theoretical principles.

**Redesigning the medical match**:

- The original NRMP algorithm was hospital-proposing, favoring hospitals over doctors
- Roth redesigned it in 1995 to be doctor-proposing, making it strategy-proof for doctors
- He also solved the "couples problem" — when two married doctors need positions in the same city, the standard algorithm can fail. Roth developed extensions that handle couples

**School choice**:

- In many cities, students are assigned to public schools through chaotic systems that reward gaming and manipulation
- Roth (with Atila Abdulkadiroglu) redesigned school choice systems in New York City (2003) and Boston (2005) using variants of the deferred acceptance algorithm
- The new systems are strategy-proof — families can honestly rank their preferred schools without worrying about gaming the system
- Result: better matches, less stress, and more equitable access to good schools

**Kidney exchange** — Roth's most dramatic application:

- Many kidney patients have a willing donor whose kidney is incompatible. Patient A needs a kidney that donor B has, and patient B needs a kidney that donor A has — but they don't know each other
- Roth designed **kidney exchange programs** that find these complementary pairs and arrange simultaneous swaps. He extended this to chains of three, four, or more pairs
- The New England Program for Kidney Exchange, which Roth helped create, has saved thousands of lives
- This is market design at its most profound — using economic theory to literally keep people alive

## Why Matching Markets Are Special

Matching markets differ from ordinary markets in fundamental ways:

- **No prices**: You can't buy a spouse, a school seat, or a kidney. Allocation must happen through other mechanisms
- **Two-sided choice**: Both sides must agree. A school can't force a student to attend, and a student can't force a school to accept them
- **Preferences matter**: Unlike commodity markets where one unit is as good as another, matching markets involve heterogeneous goods — each doctor-hospital pair has a unique value
- **Thickness, congestion, and safety**: Roth identified three requirements for well-functioning matching markets — enough participants (thickness), enough time to evaluate options (managing congestion), and safety to reveal true preferences (strategy-proofness)

Their 2012 Nobel Prize was awarded "for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine your class is picking teams for a science project. Everyone writes down who they want to work with. The problem: your first choice might not pick you back. And if people just pair up randomly, some kids will be unhappy and try to switch — causing chaos. Shapley invented a clever system: everyone takes turns proposing partners, and you can always trade up if someone better asks you, but you're never left without a partner. No pair of kids ends up wishing they were together instead — that's a "stable" match. Then Roth took this idea and used it for real life. He helped match doctors to hospitals, kids to schools, and — most amazingly — he helped people who need kidney transplants find donors. His matching system has saved thousands of lives, all based on the math of picking the right partner.

## 没有价格的市场

并非所有市场都使用价格。你不能买到婚姻。你不能（合法地）购买肾脏。你不能竞标公立学校的名额。然而这些都是分配问题——稀缺资源必须与想要它们的人匹配。

当金钱无法发挥作用时，如何设计一个产生良好匹配的系统？这就是**匹配市场**的问题，2012年诺贝尔奖表彰了在数学上解决它的理论家和使其在实践中运作的工程师。

沙普利，一位数学家，1962年证明了稳定匹配总是存在的，并设计了找到它们的算法。罗斯，一位经济学家，将沙普利的理论从黑板上带到了现实世界——重新设计了将医生匹配到医院、学生匹配到学校、肾脏捐献者匹配到受者的系统。

## 沙普利：稳定匹配理论

1962年，盖尔和沙普利提出了一个看似简单的问题：你能否总是找到一种稳定的方式将男女配成对？

如果没有两个人愿意离开各自的伴侣而互相匹配，则匹配是**稳定的**。如果存在这样的一对，他们就有动机脱离——使匹配不稳定。

**盖尔-沙普利延迟接受算法**：

1. 每个男性向他的首选女性求婚
2. 收到多个求婚的女性保留最喜欢的，拒绝其余
3. 被拒绝的男性向下一个选择求婚
4. 过程重复直到每个人都配对

盖尔和沙普利证明了三个非凡的结果：

- **存在性**：算法总是以稳定匹配终止——无论偏好是什么。稳定解总是存在的
- **最优性**：当男性求婚时，结果是对男性最好的稳定匹配（对女性最差）。当女性求婚时，反之。求婚方获得优势
- **防策略性**：求婚方没有动机虚报偏好——诚实是最佳策略。但接受方可能从策略行为中获益

这些结果纯粹是理论性的——沙普利是一位对优雅证明感兴趣的数学家，而非实际应用。需要罗斯来看到现实世界的潜力。

## 罗斯：从理论到拯救生命的实践

罗斯有一个非凡的发现：自1952年以来将医学毕业生匹配到医院住院医师职位的全国住院医师匹配项目（NRMP），本质上在使用盖尔-沙普利算法——而不自知。该系统通过试错演化到了稳定性。

这一洞见开启了罗斯作为**经济工程师**的职业生涯——使用理论原则设计真实市场的人。

**重新设计医疗匹配**：

- 原始NRMP算法是医院求婚的，有利于医院而非医生
- 罗斯在1995年将其重新设计为医生求婚的，使其对医生防策略
- 他还解决了"夫妻问题"——当两位已婚医生需要在同一城市的职位时，标准算法可能失败。罗斯开发了处理夫妻的扩展

**学校选择**：

- 在许多城市，学生通过混乱的系统被分配到公立学校，这些系统奖励博弈和操纵
- 罗斯（与阿布杜尔卡迪罗格鲁）使用延迟接受算法的变体重新设计了纽约市（2003年）和波士顿（2005年）的学校选择系统
- 新系统是防策略的——家庭可以诚实地排列他们偏好的学校，无需担心博弈系统
- 结果：更好的匹配、更少的压力、更公平地获得好学校

**肾脏交换**——罗斯最戏剧性的应用：

- 许多肾脏患者有一个愿意捐献但肾脏不兼容的捐献者。患者A需要捐献者B的肾脏，患者B需要捐献者A的肾脏——但他们互不相识
- 罗斯设计了**肾脏交换项目**，找到这些互补配对并安排同时交换。他将此扩展到三个、四个或更多配对的链条
- 罗斯帮助创建的新英格兰肾脏交换项目已经挽救了数千人的生命
- 这是最深刻的市场设计——用经济理论真正地让人活下去

## 为什么匹配市场是特殊的

匹配市场在根本方面不同于普通市场：

- **没有价格**：你不能买配偶、学校名额或肾脏。分配必须通过其他机制进行
- **双边选择**：双方必须同意。学校不能强迫学生入学，学生不能强迫学校录取
- **偏好很重要**：不像商品市场中一个单位和另一个一样好，匹配市场涉及异质商品——每个医生-医院配对有独特价值
- **厚度、拥堵和安全**：罗斯确定了运作良好的匹配市场的三个要求——足够的参与者（厚度）、足够的时间评估选项（管理拥堵）、以及揭示真实偏好的安全性（防策略性）

他们2012年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其稳定分配理论和市场设计实践。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你们班在为科学项目选队友。每个人写下想和谁一起。问题是：你的第一选择可能不会选你。如果人们随机配对，有些孩子会不开心并试图换——造成混乱。沙普利发明了一个聪明的系统：每个人轮流提议伙伴，如果有更好的人邀请你，你总是可以换，但你永远不会没有伙伴。没有一对孩子最终希望他们在一起——这就是"稳定"匹配。然后罗斯把这个想法用到了现实生活中。他帮助将医生匹配到医院，孩子匹配到学校，而且——最令人惊叹的是——他帮助需要肾脏移植的人找到捐献者。他的匹配系统已经挽救了数千人的生命，全部基于选择合适伙伴的数学。
