## The Puzzle That Classical Trade Theory Couldn't Solve

Classical trade theory, from Ricardo to Heckscher-Ohlin, had a clean story: countries trade because they're different. Portugal exports wine because it has the right climate; England exports cloth because it has the capital. Trade is driven by **comparative advantage** — differences in technology, resources, or factor endowments.

But by the late 20th century, this story couldn't explain the most important fact about world trade: **most trade occurs between similar countries exchanging similar products.** Germany exports BMWs to Sweden and imports Volvos. The United States and Japan trade cars, electronics, and machinery back and forth. This intra-industry trade between rich, similar economies dwarfs the textbook North-South exchange of manufactures for raw materials.

Paul Krugman solved this puzzle — and in doing so, created both a new trade theory and a new economic geography.

## New Trade Theory: Economies of Scale Change Everything

In 1979, Krugman published a paper that transformed international economics. The key insight: **trade can be driven by economies of scale, not just comparative advantage.**

The logic:

- Many industries have **increasing returns to scale** — the more you produce, the lower your cost per unit. Car factories, semiconductor plants, and aircraft manufacturers all become more efficient at larger volumes
- With increasing returns, it doesn't make sense for every country to produce every product. It's more efficient for each country to specialize in a few varieties and trade for the rest
- **Consumers love variety** — they'd rather choose among 50 car models than 5. Trade gives them access to varieties produced in other countries
- The result: countries that are identical in every way still benefit from trading with each other. Sweden makes Volvos, Germany makes BMWs, not because of any natural advantage, but because each has achieved economies of scale in its particular variety

Krugman built this on the **monopolistic competition** framework of Dixit and Stiglitz — a market structure where many firms each produce a slightly differentiated product. Each firm has some market power (it's the only maker of its specific variety) but faces competition from close substitutes.

## What New Trade Theory Explains

The theory resolved several puzzles that had baffled trade economists:

- **Intra-industry trade**: Why Germany and France trade cars with each other. Classical theory says identical countries have no reason to trade — Krugman showed they have every reason
- **The gravity equation**: Trade between two countries is proportional to their economic size and inversely proportional to distance — like gravitational attraction. This empirical regularity, long observed but unexplained, falls naturally out of Krugman's model
- **Gains from trade beyond comparative advantage**: Even without differences between countries, trade increases welfare by giving consumers more variety and allowing firms to achieve greater scale
- **The home market effect**: Countries with larger domestic markets tend to be net exporters of goods with strong economies of scale — because firms locate where demand is largest, then export the surplus

## New Economic Geography: Why Cities Exist

In 1991, Krugman extended his trade framework to ask an even bigger question: **why does economic activity concentrate in specific places?**

Why is the American manufacturing belt in the Midwest? Why does Silicon Valley exist in California rather than being spread evenly across the country? Why do cities form at all?

The **core-periphery model**:

- **Centripetal forces** (pulling activity together): Large markets attract firms (to be near customers). Clusters of firms attract workers (more job options). Clusters of workers attract firms (large labor pool). This creates a self-reinforcing cycle — **agglomeration**
- **Centrifugal forces** (pushing activity apart): High rents and wages in cities. Congestion and pollution. Demand from dispersed agricultural populations that must be served locally
- **The balance**: When transport costs are high, firms must locate near dispersed customers — activity spreads out. When transport costs fall below a critical threshold, agglomeration forces dominate — activity concentrates dramatically. A small change in transport costs can trigger a massive geographic reorganization

This explained the historical pattern of industrialization: as railroads and steamships reduced transport costs in the 19th century, manufacturing concentrated in a few regions (the Rust Belt, the Ruhr Valley, the English Midlands), while other areas deindustrialized.

## The Policy Implications

Krugman's work had uncomfortable implications for trade policy:

- **History and accident matter**: Which country produces which product may be determined by historical accident rather than fundamental advantage. The first country to achieve scale in an industry may lock in that advantage
- **Strategic trade policy**: If economies of scale create winner-take-all dynamics, governments might benefit from subsidizing domestic firms to help them achieve scale before foreign competitors. This challenged the free-trade consensus — though Krugman himself cautioned that the practical difficulties of such policies usually outweigh the benefits
- **Geography is not destiny — but it's powerful**: The location of economic activity depends on a complex interplay of scale economies, transport costs, and historical path dependence. Policy can influence these forces, but not easily

His 2008 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine two towns that are exactly the same — same people, same weather, same everything. You'd think they have no reason to trade. But what if one town's baker makes amazing chocolate cake, and the other town's baker makes amazing strawberry cake? Both towns are better off trading cakes, even though both could make either kind. That's because each baker gets really good (and really fast) by focusing on just one type. Krugman showed that countries work the same way — Sweden makes Volvos and Germany makes BMWs, not because of anything special about each country, but because focusing on one type of car makes you really efficient. He also explained why factories and shops cluster together in cities instead of spreading out evenly — it's like how food trucks gather at the same corner, because that's where the hungry people are, and hungry people go there because that's where the food trucks are.

## 古典贸易理论无法解决的谜题

从李嘉图到赫克歇尔-俄林的古典贸易理论有一个清晰的故事：国家之间贸易是因为它们不同。葡萄牙出口葡萄酒因为它有合适的气候；英国出口布匹因为它有资本。贸易由**比较优势**驱动——技术、资源或要素禀赋的差异。

但到20世纪末，这个故事无法解释世界贸易中最重要的事实：**大多数贸易发生在相似国家之间，交换相似产品。** 德国向瑞典出口宝马，进口沃尔沃。美国和日本来回交易汽车、电子产品和机械。富裕、相似经济体之间的产业内贸易远超教科书中南北之间制成品换原材料的交换。

克鲁格曼解决了这个谜题——并由此创造了新贸易理论和新经济地理学。

## 新贸易理论：规模经济改变一切

1979年，克鲁格曼发表了一篇改变国际经济学的论文。核心洞见：**贸易可以由规模经济驱动，而不仅仅是比较优势。**

逻辑：

- 许多产业具有**规模报酬递增**——生产越多，单位成本越低。汽车工厂、半导体工厂和飞机制造商在更大产量下都变得更高效
- 有了规模报酬递增，每个国家生产每种产品就没有意义。每个国家专注于少数品种并通过贸易获取其余的更有效率
- **消费者喜爱多样性**——他们宁愿在50种车型中选择而非5种。贸易让他们获得其他国家生产的品种
- 结果：在各方面完全相同的国家仍然从互相贸易中受益。瑞典制造沃尔沃，德国制造宝马，不是因为任何自然优势，而是因为每个国家在其特定品种上实现了规模经济

克鲁格曼在迪克西特和斯蒂格利茨的**垄断竞争**框架上构建了这一理论——一种许多企业各自生产略有差异产品的市场结构。每家企业有一定市场力量（它是其特定品种的唯一制造商）但面临来自近似替代品的竞争。

## 新贸易理论解释了什么

该理论解决了困扰贸易经济学家的几个谜题：

- **产业内贸易**：为什么德国和法国互相交易汽车。古典理论说相同的国家没有贸易理由——克鲁格曼证明它们有充分理由
- **引力方程**：两国之间的贸易与其经济规模成正比，与距离成反比——像万有引力。这一长期观察到但未被解释的经验规律，自然地从克鲁格曼的模型中产生
- **超越比较优势的贸易收益**：即使国家之间没有差异，贸易也通过给消费者更多选择和让企业实现更大规模来增加福利
- **本地市场效应**：国内市场较大的国家往往是具有强规模经济的商品的净出口国——因为企业在需求最大的地方设厂，然后出口剩余

## 新经济地理学：城市为什么存在

1991年，克鲁格曼将其贸易框架扩展到一个更大的问题：**为什么经济活动集中在特定地点？**

为什么美国制造业带在中西部？为什么硅谷在加利福尼亚而不是均匀分布在全国？为什么城市会形成？

**核心-外围模型**：

- **向心力**（将活动拉到一起）：大市场吸引企业（靠近客户）。企业集群吸引工人（更多就业选择）。工人集群吸引企业（大劳动力池）。这创造了自我强化的循环——**集聚**
- **离心力**（将活动推开）：城市的高租金和高工资。拥堵和污染。分散的农业人口的需求必须在当地满足
- **平衡**：当运输成本高时，企业必须靠近分散的客户——活动分散。当运输成本降到临界阈值以下时，集聚力量占主导——活动急剧集中。运输成本的小变化可以触发大规模的地理重组

这解释了工业化的历史模式：随着19世纪铁路和轮船降低了运输成本，制造业集中在少数地区（铁锈带、鲁尔区、英格兰中部），而其他地区去工业化。

## 政策含义

克鲁格曼的工作对贸易政策有令人不安的含义：

- **历史和偶然性很重要**：哪个国家生产哪种产品可能由历史偶然而非根本优势决定。第一个在某产业实现规模的国家可能锁定该优势
- **战略贸易政策**：如果规模经济创造赢者通吃的动态，政府可能通过补贴国内企业帮助它们在外国竞争者之前实现规模而受益。这挑战了自由贸易共识——尽管克鲁格曼本人警告说这类政策的实际困难通常超过收益
- **地理不是命运——但它很强大**：经济活动的区位取决于规模经济、运输成本和历史路径依赖的复杂互动。政策可以影响这些力量，但并不容易

他2008年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对贸易模式和经济活动区位的分析。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象两个完全一样的小镇——同样的人、同样的天气、一切都一样。你会觉得它们没有理由贸易。但如果一个镇的面包师做了很棒的巧克力蛋糕，另一个镇的面包师做了很棒的草莓蛋糕呢？两个镇交换蛋糕都更好，即使两个都能做任何一种。这是因为每个面包师专注于一种类型就变得非常擅长（也非常快）。克鲁格曼证明国家也是这样运作的——瑞典制造沃尔沃，德国制造宝马，不是因为每个国家有什么特别的，而是因为专注于一种车型让你非常高效。他还解释了为什么工厂和商店聚集在城市而不是均匀分散——就像餐车聚集在同一个街角，因为那里有饥饿的人，而饥饿的人去那里是因为那里有餐车。
