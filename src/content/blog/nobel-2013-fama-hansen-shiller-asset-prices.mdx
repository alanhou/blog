## The Paradox at the Heart of Finance

There is no way to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks. But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years.

This paradox — short-term unpredictability combined with long-term predictability — is the central finding of the 2013 Nobel Prize. Three economists, approaching asset prices from very different angles and reaching seemingly contradictory conclusions, together painted the most complete picture we have of how financial markets work.

Eugene Fama showed that markets are remarkably efficient in the short run. Robert Shiller showed that markets can be wildly irrational in the long run. Lars Peter Hansen built the econometric tools to rigorously test both claims.

## Fama: The Efficient Market Hypothesis

In the early 1960s, Eugene Fama examined stock price data and found a striking pattern: **price changes are essentially unpredictable.** Tomorrow's stock price is as likely to go up as down, regardless of what happened today or yesterday.

This led to the **efficient market hypothesis (EMH)**: asset prices reflect all available information. If a stock is underpriced, someone will buy it, pushing the price up. If it's overpriced, someone will sell, pushing it down. This happens so fast that by the time you hear about an opportunity, it's already gone.

Fama distinguished three forms of efficiency:

- **Weak form**: Prices reflect all past trading information. You can't profit from studying price charts (technical analysis doesn't work)
- **Semi-strong form**: Prices reflect all publicly available information. You can't profit from reading financial statements or news (fundamental analysis doesn't work either)
- **Strong form**: Prices reflect all information, including insider knowledge. Even insiders can't consistently profit

The evidence Fama assembled was powerful:

- Stock prices follow a random walk — past returns don't predict future returns
- Mutual fund managers, on average, don't beat the market after fees. The few who do are statistically indistinguishable from luck
- Prices adjust to new information (earnings announcements, mergers) within minutes, leaving no exploitable window

The practical implication was revolutionary: **most investors should buy index funds** rather than trying to pick stocks. This insight spawned the multi-trillion-dollar index fund industry.

## Shiller: Irrational Exuberance and Long-Run Predictability

Robert Shiller looked at the same markets and saw something very different. While Fama focused on short-term price changes, Shiller examined long-term price levels — and found them far too volatile to be explained by rational responses to information.

**Excess volatility**: In 1981, Shiller showed that stock prices fluctuate far more than the underlying dividends they're supposed to reflect. If prices equal the discounted value of future dividends, and dividends are relatively smooth, why do prices swing so wildly? Something beyond rational information processing must be at work.

**Long-run predictability**: Shiller discovered that the **price-to-earnings ratio** (specifically his cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, or CAPE) predicts stock returns over the next 3-10 years. When stocks are expensive relative to earnings, future returns tend to be low. When they're cheap, future returns tend to be high. This directly contradicts the efficient market hypothesis — if markets are efficient, no publicly available ratio should predict returns.

**Behavioral explanations**: Shiller argued that psychology drives much of market behavior:

- **Irrational exuberance**: Shiller coined this phrase (later used by Fed Chairman Greenspan) to describe the speculative bubbles that periodically grip markets. He warned about the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the housing bubble in 2005 — both before they burst
- **Feedback loops**: Rising prices create optimism, which attracts more buyers, which pushes prices higher — a self-reinforcing cycle disconnected from fundamentals
- **Narrative economics**: Stories and media coverage shape investor sentiment, driving prices away from rational values

## Hansen: The Tools to Test Both

Lars Peter Hansen developed the **Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)** — a statistical framework flexible enough to test asset pricing models without requiring all the restrictive assumptions of traditional methods.

Why GMM matters:

- **Testing efficiency**: Asset pricing theories make predictions about the relationship between risk and return. Hansen's GMM provides a rigorous way to test whether observed prices are consistent with these theories — or whether they reveal anomalies
- **The Hansen-Jagannathan bound**: Hansen (with Ravi Jagannathan) derived bounds on how volatile the "stochastic discount factor" must be to explain observed asset returns. When actual returns violate these bounds, something is wrong with the model — pointing to either market inefficiency or missing risk factors
- **The equity premium puzzle**: Hansen's methods helped quantify one of finance's deepest puzzles — stocks have historically returned far more than bonds, more than any standard model of risk aversion can explain. This "equity premium puzzle" remains unsolved and suggests our models of risk are incomplete

## The Productive Disagreement

The beauty of the 2013 prize was honoring three scholars who fundamentally disagree:

- **Fama** says markets are efficient — prices reflect information, and apparent anomalies are compensation for risk
- **Shiller** says markets are driven by psychology — bubbles and crashes reflect human irrationality, not rational risk assessment
- **Hansen** says we need better tools and models — the disagreement between Fama and Shiller may reflect our incomplete understanding of risk rather than a simple right-or-wrong answer

The resolution may be that both are right at different time horizons: markets are impressively efficient at processing information day-to-day, but human psychology creates slow-moving waves of optimism and pessimism that make long-run returns predictable.

Their 2013 Nobel Prize was awarded "for their empirical analysis of asset prices."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine a jar of jellybeans at a school fair. Everyone guesses how many are inside. Fama discovered that if you average all the guesses, the crowd gets amazingly close to the right answer — that's like the stock market being "efficient." No single person can consistently guess better than the crowd. But Shiller noticed something else: sometimes everyone gets excited and guesses way too high, and sometimes everyone gets scared and guesses way too low. Over a few years, these mood swings are predictable — after everyone guesses too high, the next round of guesses tends to come back down. And Hansen? He built the ruler to measure exactly how far off the guesses are, so we can tell whether the crowd is being smart or silly.

## 金融学核心的悖论

没有办法预测未来几天或几周的股票和债券价格。但完全有可能预见这些价格在更长时期内的大致走向，比如未来三到五年。

这一悖论——短期不可预测性与长期可预测性的结合——是2013年诺贝尔奖的核心发现。三位经济学家从非常不同的角度研究资产价格，得出看似矛盾的结论，共同描绘了我们对金融市场运作方式最完整的图景。

法玛证明市场在短期内非常有效。席勒证明市场在长期内可能极度非理性。汉森构建了严格检验两种主张的计量经济学工具。

## 法玛：有效市场假说

1960年代初，法玛检查了股价数据，发现了一个惊人的模式：**价格变化基本上不可预测。** 明天的股价上涨和下跌的可能性一样大，无论今天或昨天发生了什么。

这导致了**有效市场假说（EMH）**：资产价格反映了所有可用信息。如果一只股票被低估，有人会买入，推高价格。如果被高估，有人会卖出，压低价格。这发生得如此之快，以至于当你听到机会时，它已经消失了。

法玛区分了三种形式的效率：

- **弱式**：价格反映所有过去的交易信息。你不能从研究价格图表中获利（技术分析不管用）
- **半强式**：价格反映所有公开可用的信息。你不能从阅读财务报表或新闻中获利（基本面分析也不管用）
- **强式**：价格反映所有信息，包括内幕知识。即使内部人士也不能持续获利

法玛收集的证据很有力：

- 股价遵循随机游走——过去的收益不能预测未来的收益
- 共同基金经理在扣除费用后平均不能战胜市场。少数做到的在统计上与运气无法区分
- 价格在几分钟内就对新信息（盈利公告、并购）做出调整，不留可利用的窗口

实际含义是革命性的：**大多数投资者应该购买指数基金**而非试图选股。这一洞见催生了数万亿美元的指数基金行业。

## 席勒：非理性繁荣与长期可预测性

席勒看着同样的市场，却看到了非常不同的东西。法玛关注短期价格变化，席勒则检查长期价格水平——发现它们的波动远超理性信息反应所能解释的。

**过度波动**：1981年，席勒证明股价的波动远大于它们应该反映的基础股利。如果价格等于未来股利的贴现值，而股利相对平稳，为什么价格波动如此剧烈？理性信息处理之外一定有什么在起作用。

**长期可预测性**：席勒发现**市盈率**（特别是他的周期调整市盈率，即CAPE）可以预测未来3-10年的股票收益。当股票相对于盈利昂贵时，未来收益往往较低。当便宜时，未来收益往往较高。这直接矛盾有效市场假说——如果市场有效，没有公开可用的比率应该能预测收益。

**行为解释**：席勒认为心理学驱动了大部分市场行为：

- **非理性繁荣**：席勒创造了这个短语（后被美联储主席格林斯潘使用）来描述周期性席卷市场的投机泡沫。他在2000年警告了互联网泡沫，在2005年警告了房地产泡沫——都在它们破裂之前
- **反馈循环**：价格上涨创造乐观情绪，吸引更多买家，推动价格更高——一个与基本面脱节的自我强化循环
- **叙事经济学**：故事和媒体报道塑造投资者情绪，推动价格偏离理性价值

## 汉森：检验两者的工具

汉森发展了**广义矩方法（GMM）**——一个足够灵活的统计框架，可以在不需要传统方法所有限制性假设的情况下检验资产定价模型。

GMM为什么重要：

- **检验效率**：资产定价理论对风险与收益之间的关系做出预测。汉森的GMM提供了严格的方法来检验观察到的价格是否与这些理论一致——或者是否揭示了异常
- **汉森-贾甘纳坦界**：汉森（与贾甘纳坦）推导出"随机贴现因子"必须有多大波动才能解释观察到的资产收益的界限。当实际收益违反这些界限时，模型有问题——指向市场无效或遗漏的风险因素
- **股权溢价之谜**：汉森的方法帮助量化了金融学最深层的谜题之一——股票的历史收益远高于债券，超出任何标准风险厌恶模型所能解释的。这个"股权溢价之谜"至今未解，暗示我们的风险模型不完整

## 富有成效的分歧

2013年奖的美妙之处在于表彰了三位根本性分歧的学者：

- **法玛**说市场是有效的——价格反映信息，表面上的异常是对风险的补偿
- **席勒**说市场由心理学驱动——泡沫和崩盘反映人类非理性，而非理性风险评估
- **汉森**说我们需要更好的工具和模型——法玛和席勒之间的分歧可能反映我们对风险的不完整理解，而非简单的对错之分

解决方案可能是两者在不同时间跨度上都是对的：市场在日常信息处理上令人印象深刻地有效，但人类心理学创造了缓慢移动的乐观和悲观浪潮，使长期收益可预测。

他们2013年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对资产价格的实证分析。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象学校集市上有一罐糖豆。每个人猜里面有多少颗。法玛发现如果你把所有猜测平均，人群会惊人地接近正确答案——这就像股市是"有效的"。没有一个人能持续比人群猜得更好。但席勒注意到了别的东西：有时每个人都兴奋起来猜得太高，有时每个人都害怕猜得太低。几年内，这些情绪波动是可预测的——在每个人猜得太高之后，下一轮猜测往往会回落。而汉森呢？他造了一把尺子来精确测量猜测偏离了多远，这样我们就能判断人群是聪明还是愚蠢。
