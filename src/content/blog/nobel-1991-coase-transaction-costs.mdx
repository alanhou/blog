## Two Papers, Two Revolutions

Ronald Coase won the Nobel Prize for two papers — one written when he was 26, the other when he was 49. Together they total fewer than 60 pages. They contain no mathematics, no econometrics, no formal models. Yet they changed economics more profoundly than most thousand-page treatises.

The first paper, *The Nature of the Firm* (1937), asked: why do firms exist? The second, *The Problem of Social Cost* (1960), asked: how should society deal with externalities like pollution? Both answers turned on the same concept — **transaction costs** — and both overturned conventional wisdom that had gone unquestioned for decades.

## The Nature of the Firm: Why Don't We All Just Freelance?

In a market economy, prices coordinate everything. If you need a shirt made, you could contract with a cotton grower, a weaver, a cutter, and a seamstress — each transaction guided by market prices. So why do we have firms — organizations where a boss tells workers what to do, replacing market coordination with hierarchy?

Before Coase, no one had a good answer. Economists simply assumed firms existed and analyzed how they behaved. Coase asked the prior question: **why does the firm exist at all?**

His answer: **transaction costs.** Using the market isn't free. Every market transaction involves:

- **Search costs**: Finding the right trading partner
- **Negotiation costs**: Agreeing on terms, prices, and quality
- **Contracting costs**: Writing and enforcing contracts
- **Monitoring costs**: Ensuring the other party performs as promised

When these costs are high, it's cheaper to bring activities inside a firm — replacing market transactions with managerial direction. The boss says "make shirts" and workers comply, without negotiating each step.

But firms have costs too — bureaucracy, coordination problems, loss of incentives. So the firm expands until the cost of organizing one more transaction internally equals the cost of conducting it on the market. **The boundary of the firm is determined by the relative costs of internal organization versus market exchange.**

This simple insight explains an enormous range of phenomena:

- Why firms vertically integrate (high transaction costs with suppliers)
- Why firms outsource (low transaction costs, high internal costs)
- Why firm size varies across industries (different transaction cost structures)
- Why the digital revolution has enabled smaller firms (technology reduces transaction costs)

## The Problem of Social Cost: The Coase Theorem

A factory pollutes a river, harming a downstream fishery. The textbook solution: tax the factory or regulate its emissions. Coase showed this analysis was incomplete — and potentially wrong.

The key insight: **externalities are reciprocal.** Stopping the factory's pollution harms the factory owner just as the pollution harms the fisherman. The real question isn't "who is causing harm?" but "what arrangement produces the most value?"

The **Coase theorem** (named by George Stigler, not Coase himself):

**If property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are zero, parties will bargain to reach the efficient outcome regardless of who initially holds the rights.**

Give the fisherman the right to clean water, and the factory will pay him for permission to pollute — but only if the factory's profits exceed the fisherman's losses. Give the factory the right to pollute, and the fisherman will pay the factory to reduce emissions — but only if his losses exceed the factory's cost of abatement. Either way, the efficient outcome is reached.

## Why Transaction Costs Are the Real Point

Coase himself insisted that the zero-transaction-cost case was not the point. It was a thought experiment to show that **the real world departs from efficiency precisely because transaction costs are positive.**

When transaction costs are high:

- **Property rights allocation matters**: Unlike the zero-cost case, who gets the rights affects the outcome. Legal rules and institutional design become crucial
- **Bargaining may fail**: If negotiation is costly, parties may not reach efficient agreements. Pollution may persist even when abatement would create more value than it costs
- **Government intervention may help — or hurt**: Regulation can sometimes reduce transaction costs (by setting clear rules), but it can also increase them (through bureaucracy and compliance costs). The question is always comparative: is government intervention cheaper than the market failure it's trying to fix?

This comparative institutional analysis — comparing imperfect markets with imperfect governments — became Coase's lasting methodological contribution. Don't compare real markets to ideal governments; compare real markets to real governments.

## The Birth of Law and Economics

*The Problem of Social Cost* didn't just change economics — it created a new field. **Law and economics** applies economic reasoning to legal rules, asking: how do legal institutions affect economic efficiency?

Coase showed that legal rules are essentially allocations of property rights — and that these allocations have economic consequences. This insight transformed how lawyers, judges, and legal scholars think about:

- Tort law (who should bear the cost of accidents?)
- Contract law (what default rules minimize transaction costs?)
- Property law (how should rights be defined and enforced?)
- Environmental law (regulation vs. tradeable permits vs. liability rules)

His 1991 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his discovery and clarification of the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy."

## Explain It to a Child

> Why does your school have a principal and teachers instead of just hiring a different person for every single lesson? Because it would be a nightmare to find, interview, and make deals with a new person every hour. It's easier to have a school where the principal organizes everything. That's what Coase figured out about companies — they exist because doing everything through individual deals is too much hassle. He also discovered something about neighbors: if your dog keeps digging up my garden, it doesn't matter whether the law says "your dog must stop" or "I must build a fence" — as long as we can talk it out, we'll find the best solution. The problem is when talking it out is too hard or too expensive.

## 两篇论文，两场革命

科斯凭借两篇论文获得诺贝尔奖——一篇写于26岁，另一篇写于49岁。两篇加起来不到60页。没有数学，没有计量经济学，没有形式化模型。然而它们对经济学的改变比大多数千页巨著都深刻。

第一篇论文《企业的性质》（1937年）问：企业为何存在？第二篇《社会成本问题》（1960年）问：社会应如何处理污染等外部性？两个答案都围绕同一个概念——**交易成本**——两者都推翻了数十年来无人质疑的传统智慧。

---

## 企业的性质：为什么我们不都做自由职业者？

在市场经济中，价格协调一切。如果你需要做一件衬衫，你可以分别与棉花种植者、织布工、裁剪工和缝纫工签约——每笔交易由市场价格引导。那为什么我们有企业——由老板告诉工人做什么、用等级制度取代市场协调的组织？

在科斯之前，没有人有好的答案。经济学家只是假设企业存在，然后分析它们的行为。科斯问了一个更根本的问题：**企业为什么存在？**

他的答案：**交易成本。** 使用市场不是免费的。每笔市场交易都涉及：

- **搜索成本**：找到合适的交易伙伴
- **谈判成本**：就条款、价格和质量达成一致
- **签约成本**：起草和执行合同
- **监督成本**：确保对方按承诺履行

当这些成本很高时，将活动纳入企业内部更便宜——用管理指令取代市场交易。老板说"做衬衫"，工人照办，无需逐步谈判。

但企业也有成本——官僚主义、协调问题、激励丧失。因此企业扩张到内部组织一笔额外交易的成本等于在市场上进行该交易的成本时停止。**企业的边界由内部组织与市场交换的相对成本决定。**

这个简单的洞见解释了大量现象：

- 为什么企业纵向整合（与供应商的交易成本高）
- 为什么企业外包（交易成本低，内部成本高）
- 为什么不同行业的企业规模不同（不同的交易成本结构）
- 为什么数字革命催生了更小的企业（技术降低了交易成本）

## 社会成本问题：科斯定理

一家工厂污染了河流，损害了下游的渔场。教科书的解决方案：对工厂征税或管制其排放。科斯证明这种分析是不完整的——而且可能是错误的。

关键洞见：**外部性是相互的。** 阻止工厂污染损害了工厂主，正如污染损害了渔民。真正的问题不是"谁在造成损害？"而是"什么安排能产生最大价值？"

**科斯定理**（由斯蒂格勒命名，而非科斯本人）：

**如果产权明确界定且交易成本为零，各方将通过谈判达到有效结果，无论谁最初持有权利。**

给渔民清洁水的权利，工厂会付钱给他换取排污许可——但仅当工厂利润超过渔民损失时。给工厂排污权，渔民会付钱给工厂减少排放——但仅当他的损失超过工厂的减排成本时。无论哪种方式，都能达到有效结果。

## 为什么交易成本才是真正的重点

科斯本人坚持认为零交易成本的情况不是重点。它是一个思想实验，用来表明**现实世界之所以偏离效率，恰恰是因为交易成本为正。**

当交易成本很高时：

- **产权分配很重要**：与零成本情况不同，谁获得权利会影响结果。法律规则和制度设计变得至关重要
- **谈判可能失败**：如果谈判成本高昂，各方可能无法达成有效协议。即使减排创造的价值超过其成本，污染也可能持续
- **政府干预可能有帮助——也可能有害**：监管有时可以降低交易成本（通过设定明确规则），但也可能增加交易成本（通过官僚主义和合规成本）。问题始终是比较性的：政府干预是否比它试图修复的市场失灵更便宜？

这种比较制度分析——比较不完美的市场与不完美的政府——成为科斯持久的方法论贡献。不要拿真实市场与理想政府比较；要拿真实市场与真实政府比较。

## 法律经济学的诞生

《社会成本问题》不仅改变了经济学——它创造了一个新领域。**法律经济学**将经济推理应用于法律规则，追问：法律制度如何影响经济效率？

科斯证明法律规则本质上是产权的分配——而这些分配有经济后果。这一洞见改变了律师、法官和法学学者思考以下问题的方式：

- 侵权法（谁应承担事故成本？）
- 合同法（什么默认规则能最小化交易成本？）
- 财产法（权利应如何界定和执行？）
- 环境法（监管 vs. 可交易许可证 vs. 责任规则）

他1991年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其发现和阐明了交易成本和产权对经济制度结构和运行的重要意义。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 为什么你的学校有校长和老师，而不是每节课都雇一个不同的人？因为每小时都去找人、面试、谈条件简直是噩梦。有一所学校让校长统一组织一切更容易。这就是科斯对企业的发现——企业存在是因为什么都通过单独交易来做太麻烦了。他还发现了一个关于邻居的道理：如果你的狗总是刨我的花园，法律规定"你的狗必须停下"还是"我必须建围栏"其实不重要——只要我们能商量，就会找到最好的解决办法。问题在于商量本身太难或太贵的时候。
