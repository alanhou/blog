## The Most Dangerous Institution in the Economy

Banks are strange institutions. They take your money and promise you can have it back anytime. Then they lend most of it to someone else for 30 years. As long as everyone doesn't ask for their money at the same time, this works beautifully — banks create liquidity, fund investment, and power economic growth.

But if everyone does ask at the same time, the bank is finished. It can't recall 30-year mortgages overnight. The assets are real but illiquid; the promises are liquid but fragile. This mismatch — **maturity transformation** — is both banking's greatest contribution and its fatal vulnerability.

The 2022 Nobel Prize honored three economists who explained why this vulnerability exists, why it matters far more than anyone previously understood, and what can be done about it. Their work, all published in the early 1980s, became the intellectual foundation for how the world responded to the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 economic shock.

## Diamond and Dybvig: Why Bank Runs Happen to Healthy Banks

Before the Diamond-Dybvig model (1983), the common understanding of bank runs was simple: banks fail because they make bad loans. Depositors run because they discover the bank is insolvent. The run is a symptom, not the disease.

Diamond and Dybvig overturned this. They showed that **bank runs can happen to perfectly healthy banks** — and that the run itself destroys the bank.

**The setup**:

- People face uncertainty about when they'll need their money. Some will need it soon (to cover an emergency); others won't need it for years
- Long-term investments pay higher returns than short-term ones, but you can't get your money out early without a loss
- Without banks, people face an unpleasant choice: invest long-term and risk being stuck when an emergency hits, or keep everything in low-return liquid assets

**What banks do**:

- Banks pool deposits from many people and invest most of the pool in high-return long-term projects
- Because not everyone needs their money at the same time (by the law of large numbers), the bank keeps only a small reserve for withdrawals
- This lets depositors have the best of both worlds: access to their money anytime (liquidity) AND higher returns from long-term investment
- Banks **create liquidity** that wouldn't otherwise exist — this is their fundamental economic function

**The fatal vulnerability**:

- Bank deposits are paid out on a **first-come, first-served** basis
- If depositors believe the bank is safe, only those who genuinely need cash withdraw. The system works perfectly
- But if depositors believe others are about to withdraw, the rational response is to run to the bank and withdraw immediately — even if you don't need the money — because the last depositors in line get nothing
- **This is self-fulfilling**: the run is caused by the belief that a run will happen. A perfectly healthy bank with perfectly good loans can be destroyed by nothing more than a shift in expectations
- The bank is forced to liquidate long-term investments at a loss, destroying value that would have been there if everyone had simply stayed calm

**Two equilibria**:

The Diamond-Dybvig model has two stable outcomes:
1. **Good equilibrium**: Everyone trusts the bank, only genuine needs trigger withdrawals, and the bank functions perfectly
2. **Bad equilibrium**: Everyone panics, everyone runs, and the bank collapses — even though there was nothing wrong with it

What tips the economy from one equilibrium to the other? Anything. A rumor. A news headline. Another bank's failure. The fragility is inherent in the structure of banking itself.

**The solution: deposit insurance**

Diamond and Dybvig showed that **government-backed deposit insurance** eliminates the bad equilibrium entirely. If depositors know they'll get their money back regardless of what others do, they have no reason to run. The insurance almost never needs to be paid out — its mere existence prevents the panic.

This provided the theoretical justification for deposit insurance programs (like the FDIC in the United States, established in 1933 after thousands of bank failures during the Great Depression).

## Diamond: Banks as Delegated Monitors

In a separate 1984 paper, Douglas Diamond explained another crucial function of banks: **delegated monitoring**.

**The problem**: When you lend money to a business, you need to monitor whether the borrower is using it wisely. But monitoring is expensive, and if thousands of small savers each try to monitor the same borrower, the duplication is wasteful.

**The solution**: Banks act as **delegated monitors** — they pool deposits from many savers and monitor borrowers on everyone's behalf. This is efficient because:

- One monitor (the bank) replaces thousands of individual monitors
- The bank develops expertise in evaluating and monitoring borrowers
- By lending to many different borrowers, the bank diversifies risk — if one borrower defaults, the others' payments cover the loss
- Diversification is so effective that depositors can be promised a fixed return — they don't need to worry about individual loan performance

This explains why banks exist at all, rather than everyone lending directly through financial markets. Banks solve an **information problem** that markets handle poorly.

## Bernanke: How Bank Failures Caused the Great Depression

Ben Bernanke asked one of the most important questions in economic history: **why did a moderate recession in 1929 become the worst economic catastrophe of the twentieth century?**

The standard answer pointed to monetary policy — the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to contract. But Bernanke showed that money supply alone couldn't explain the depth and duration of the Depression. Something else was amplifying the damage.

**Bernanke's insight**: The wave of bank failures between 1930 and 1933 didn't just destroy money — it destroyed **information**.

- Banks spend years building knowledge about their borrowers — which businesses are creditworthy, which projects are viable, which entrepreneurs can be trusted
- When a bank fails, this information is lost. It can't be written down or transferred. It exists in relationships, in loan officers' judgment, in institutional memory
- New lenders can't simply step in and replace the failed bank. They don't know the borrowers. They can't distinguish good risks from bad risks. So they either don't lend at all, or they charge high interest rates to compensate for their ignorance
- The **cost of credit intermediation** — the cost of connecting savers with borrowers — soars after bank failures
- Businesses that depended on bank credit can't finance their operations. Profitable projects go unfunded. Workers are laid off not because of weak demand but because their employers can't access credit

Bernanke showed empirically that regions with more bank failures experienced deeper depressions, even controlling for other factors. The timing matched: the economy began to recover only after the bank failures stopped and the financial system stabilized.

**The credit channel**: Bernanke demonstrated that banks are not just passive intermediaries shuffling money from savers to borrowers. They are active participants whose health directly affects the real economy. When the banking system breaks, the entire economy breaks with it — not just because money is scarce, but because the economy's information infrastructure is destroyed.

## How Their Work Saved the World (Twice)

The research of all three laureates converged on a single message: **banking crises are not just financial events — they are economic catastrophes that must be prevented or contained at almost any cost.**

**The 2008 financial crisis**:

When Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, the world faced a Diamond-Dybvig bank run in modern form. The "banks" weren't just traditional banks — they were investment banks, money market funds, and other financial institutions that had liquid liabilities but illiquid assets. The panic was spreading exactly as the model predicted.

Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, applied the lessons of his own research:
- The Fed extended emergency lending to prevent further bank failures — acting as a lender of last resort
- Deposit insurance was expanded to cover more accounts
- The government recapitalized failing banks to restore confidence
- The Fed cut interest rates to near zero and began massive asset purchases

These actions were politically controversial but intellectually grounded in the laureates' research. The Great Recession was severe — but it wasn't the Great Depression. Bernanke's own academic work on the 1930s was the playbook for preventing a repeat.

**The COVID-19 crisis (2020)**:

When the pandemic shut down economies worldwide, central banks and governments acted even faster, drawing again on the same framework — massive lending facilities, expanded guarantees, and aggressive monetary policy to prevent a financial system collapse on top of the health crisis.

Their 2022 Nobel Prize was awarded "for research on banks and financial crises."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine a neighborhood swimming pool that everyone shares. Everyone pays a little money each month, and the pool stays open. The pool can handle 50 people swimming at the same time — and since the whole neighborhood has 500 people but they come at different times, it works great. Now imagine someone starts a rumor: "The pool is closing tomorrow! Everyone better swim today!" If everyone shows up at once, the pool is overwhelmed, the water gets gross, and it actually does close. The rumor made itself come true. That's a bank run. A bank takes money from lots of people and lends it out. As long as everyone doesn't ask for their money back at the same time, it works perfectly. But if everyone panics and rushes to the bank at once, the bank runs out of cash — even though there was nothing actually wrong with it. Diamond and Dybvig figured out why this happens and how to stop it: promise everyone they'll get their money back no matter what (that's deposit insurance), and nobody panics. Bernanke showed that when banks DO fail, it's not just the banks that suffer — the whole economy crashes because banks know things about businesses that nobody else knows, and when that knowledge is lost, nobody can borrow money to keep working.

## 经济中最危险的机构

银行是奇特的机构。它们收取你的钱并承诺你随时可以取回。然后它们把大部分借给别人30年。只要不是所有人同时要求取回自己的钱，这运作得非常好——银行创造流动性、资助投资、推动经济增长。

但如果所有人同时要求取回，银行就完了。它不能一夜之间收回30年的抵押贷款。资产是真实的但不流动；承诺是流动的但脆弱。这种不匹配——**期限转换**——既是银行业最伟大的贡献，也是其致命弱点。

2022年诺贝尔奖表彰了三位解释这种脆弱性为何存在、为何比任何人之前理解的重要得多、以及能做什么的经济学家。他们的工作都发表于1980年代初期，成为世界应对2008年金融危机和新冠疫情经济冲击的智识基础。

## 戴蒙德和迪布维格：为什么银行挤兑会发生在健康的银行

在戴蒙德-迪布维格模型（1983年）之前，人们对银行挤兑的普遍理解很简单：银行倒闭是因为它们发放了坏贷款。储户挤兑是因为他们发现银行资不抵债。挤兑是症状，不是疾病。

戴蒙德和迪布维格推翻了这一观点。他们证明**银行挤兑可以发生在完全健康的银行**——而且挤兑本身摧毁了银行。

**模型设定**：

- 人们面临不确定性——何时需要用钱。有些人很快需要（应对紧急情况）；其他人多年不需要
- 长期投资比短期投资回报更高，但你不能提前取出而不遭受损失
- 没有银行的话，人们面临不愉快的选择：进行长期投资并冒着紧急时被套牢的风险，或者把一切都放在低回报的流动资产中

**银行做什么**：

- 银行汇集许多人的存款，将大部分资金池投资于高回报的长期项目
- 因为不是所有人同时需要钱（根据大数定律），银行只保留少量准备金用于取款
- 这让储户两全其美：随时取钱（流动性）同时获得长期投资的更高回报
- 银行**创造了**否则不会存在的流动性——这是它们的基本经济功能

**致命脆弱性**：

- 银行存款按**先来先服务**原则支付
- 如果储户相信银行安全，只有真正需要现金的人取款。系统完美运作
- 但如果储户相信其他人即将取款，理性的反应是冲到银行立即取款——即使你不需要钱——因为排在最后的储户什么都得不到
- **这是自我实现的**：挤兑是由相信挤兑会发生的信念引起的。一家拥有完全良好贷款的完全健康的银行可以仅仅因为预期的转变而被摧毁
- 银行被迫亏损清算长期投资，摧毁了如果每个人都保持冷静本会存在的价值

**两个均衡**：

戴蒙德-迪布维格模型有两个稳定结果：
1. **好均衡**：每个人信任银行，只有真正的需求触发取款，银行完美运作
2. **坏均衡**：每个人恐慌，每个人挤兑，银行崩溃——即使它本身没有任何问题

什么将经济从一个均衡推向另一个？任何事。一个谣言。一条新闻标题。另一家银行的倒闭。脆弱性内在于银行业的结构本身。

**解决方案：存款保险**

戴蒙德和迪布维格证明**政府支持的存款保险**完全消除了坏均衡。如果储户知道无论其他人做什么他们都能拿回自己的钱，他们就没有理由挤兑。保险几乎永远不需要实际赔付——它的存在本身就防止了恐慌。

这为存款保险计划（如美国的FDIC，1933年在大萧条期间数千家银行倒闭后建立）提供了理论依据。

## 戴蒙德：银行作为委托监督者

在1984年的一篇单独论文中，戴蒙德解释了银行的另一个关键功能：**委托监督**。

**问题**：当你借钱给企业时，你需要监督借款人是否明智使用。但监督成本高昂，如果数千名小储户各自试图监督同一个借款人，重复是浪费的。

**解决方案**：银行充当**委托监督者**——它们汇集许多储户的存款并代表所有人监督借款人。这是高效的，因为：

- 一个监督者（银行）取代数千个个体监督者
- 银行发展出评估和监督借款人的专业知识
- 通过向许多不同借款人放贷，银行分散风险——如果一个借款人违约，其他人的还款覆盖损失
- 分散化如此有效，以至于可以向储户承诺固定回报——他们不需要担心个别贷款表现

这解释了为什么银行存在，而不是每个人都通过金融市场直接借贷。银行解决了市场处理不好的**信息问题**。

## 伯南克：银行倒闭如何导致了大萧条

伯南克问了经济史上最重要的问题之一：**为什么1929年的温和衰退变成了二十世纪最严重的经济灾难？**

标准答案指向货币政策——美联储允许货币供应收缩。但伯南克证明仅货币供应无法解释大萧条的深度和持续时间。还有其他东西在放大损害。

**伯南克的洞见**：1930年至1933年间的银行倒闭浪潮不仅摧毁了货币——还摧毁了**信息**。

- 银行花费数年建立关于借款人的知识——哪些企业有信誉、哪些项目可行、哪些企业家可以信任
- 当银行倒闭时，这些信息丢失了。它不能被写下或转移。它存在于关系中、信贷员的判断中、机构记忆中
- 新的贷方不能简单地替代倒闭的银行。他们不了解借款人。他们无法区分好风险和坏风险。所以他们要么根本不贷款，要么收取高利率以补偿无知
- **信用中介成本**——连接储蓄者和借款人的成本——在银行倒闭后飙升
- 依赖银行信贷的企业无法为运营融资。有利可图的项目得不到资金。工人被解雇不是因为需求疲软，而是因为他们的雇主无法获得信贷

伯南克用实证数据表明，银行倒闭更多的地区经历了更深的萧条，即使控制了其他因素。时间也吻合：经济只在银行倒闭停止和金融系统稳定后才开始复苏。

**信贷渠道**：伯南克证明银行不仅仅是在储蓄者和借款人之间搬运资金的被动中介。它们是其健康状况直接影响实体经济的积极参与者。当银行系统崩溃时，整个经济随之崩溃——不仅因为资金稀缺，更因为经济的信息基础设施被摧毁。

## 他们的工作如何两次拯救了世界

三位获奖者的研究汇聚为一个信息：**银行危机不仅仅是金融事件——它们是必须以几乎任何代价预防或控制的经济灾难。**

**2008年金融危机**：

2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭时，世界面临现代形式的戴蒙德-迪布维格银行挤兑。"银行"不仅仅是传统银行——它们是投资银行、货币市场基金和其他拥有流动负债但非流动资产的金融机构。恐慌正如模型预测的那样蔓延。

时任美联储主席的伯南克运用了他自己研究的教训：
- 美联储延长紧急贷款以防止更多银行倒闭——充当最后贷款人
- 存款保险扩大覆盖更多账户
- 政府对倒闭银行注资以恢复信心
- 美联储将利率降至接近零并开始大规模资产购买

这些行动在政治上有争议，但在智识上基于获奖者的研究。大衰退是严重的——但它不是大萧条。伯南克自己关于1930年代的学术工作成为防止重演的行动手册。

**新冠疫情危机（2020年）**：

当疫情在全球范围内关闭经济时，各国央行和政府行动更快，再次借鉴同一框架——大规模贷款设施、扩大担保和积极的货币政策，以防止金融系统在健康危机之上崩溃。

他们2022年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对银行和金融危机的研究。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象一个社区共享的游泳池。每个人每月付一点钱，游泳池就保持开放。泳池一次能容纳50人游泳——因为整个社区有500人但他们在不同时间来，所以运作得很好。现在想象有人散布谣言："游泳池明天就关了！每个人今天都去游！"如果所有人同时出现，泳池不堪重负，水变脏了，它真的关门了。谣言让自己成真了。这就是银行挤兑。银行从很多人那里收钱然后借出去。只要不是所有人同时要求取回钱，它运作得完美。但如果每个人都恐慌并同时冲向银行，银行的现金就耗尽了——即使它本身实际上没有任何问题。戴蒙德和迪布维格弄清了这为什么发生以及如何阻止：承诺每个人无论如何都能拿回他们的钱（这就是存款保险），就没有人会恐慌。伯南克证明当银行确实倒闭时，不仅银行受苦——整个经济崩溃，因为银行了解企业的事情是别人不知道的，当这些知识丢失时，就没有人能借钱继续工作了。
