## Two Challenges to Orthodox Economics

The 2002 Nobel Prize was split between two scholars who challenged economics from opposite directions — and reached seemingly contradictory conclusions.

Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who never took an economics course, showed that people are systematically irrational — prone to biases, illusions, and errors that violate every assumption of rational choice theory. Vernon Smith, an economist who built laboratories to test market theories, showed that markets often work remarkably well — even when the people in them are far from the rational agents that theory assumes.

The tension between these findings is one of the most productive in modern economics: individuals are irrational, but markets can still be efficient. Understanding when and why is the frontier of behavioral and experimental economics.

## Kahneman: Prospect Theory and the Psychology of Judgment

Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (who died in 1996 and couldn't share the prize) spent decades documenting how human judgment systematically departs from rationality. Their masterwork was **prospect theory** (1979) — the most influential alternative to expected utility theory ever developed.

**Prospect theory** describes how people actually make decisions under risk, in contrast to how rational agents should:

- **Reference dependence**: People evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), not in absolute terms. A salary of $60,000 feels great if you expected $50,000, but terrible if you expected $70,000 — even though it's the same salary
- **Loss aversion**: Losses loom larger than gains. Losing $100 hurts roughly twice as much as gaining $100 feels good. This single asymmetry explains an enormous range of behavior — from why people hold losing stocks too long to why they reject favorable gambles
- **Diminishing sensitivity**: The difference between $100 and $200 feels larger than the difference between $1,100 and $1,200. People are sensitive to changes near the reference point but increasingly insensitive to changes further away
- **Probability weighting**: People overweight small probabilities (explaining lottery tickets and excessive insurance) and underweight large probabilities (explaining the certainty effect that Allais identified)

## The Catalog of Cognitive Biases

Beyond prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky documented a systematic catalog of biases in human judgment:

- **Anchoring**: People's estimates are heavily influenced by irrelevant starting points. Ask "Is the population of Turkey more or less than 5 million?" and then "What is it?" — you get a much lower answer than if the anchor was 65 million
- **Availability heuristic**: People judge the probability of events by how easily examples come to mind. Plane crashes feel more likely than car accidents because they're more memorable — even though cars are far more dangerous
- **Representativeness**: People judge probabilities by similarity rather than base rates. A quiet, bookish person seems more likely to be a librarian than a salesperson — even though there are vastly more salespeople
- **Framing effects**: The same choice described differently produces different decisions. "90% survival rate" sounds better than "10% mortality rate" — even though they're identical
- **Overconfidence**: People systematically overestimate their knowledge and abilities. Experts are often no better calibrated than novices
- **Status quo bias**: People disproportionately stick with the default option, even when switching would be beneficial

These aren't random errors — they're systematic patterns that predict behavior across cultures and contexts.

## Smith: The Laboratory as Economic Wind Tunnel

While Kahneman showed that individuals are irrational, Vernon Smith showed that markets can be tested — and often work better than anyone expected.

Starting in the 1960s, Smith pioneered **experimental economics** — bringing real people into laboratories, giving them real money, and having them trade in controlled market environments. The results were stunning:

- **Markets converge to equilibrium**: Even with just a handful of traders who know nothing about supply and demand theory, experimental markets rapidly converge to the competitive equilibrium price predicted by theory. Adam Smith's invisible hand works — even with imperfect, boundedly rational humans
- **Institutions matter**: The rules of the market — how bids are made, how information is revealed, how trades are executed — dramatically affect outcomes. A double auction (where both buyers and sellers can post prices) converges to equilibrium much faster than a posted-price market
- **Bubbles can be created and studied**: Smith created asset market experiments where bubbles reliably form and crash — providing controlled evidence about speculative dynamics that can't be studied in real markets
- **Wind tunnel testing for policy**: Just as engineers test aircraft designs in wind tunnels before building them, Smith argued that market designs should be tested in laboratories before implementation. This approach was used for designing spectrum auctions, electricity markets, and emissions trading systems

## The Productive Tension

The apparent contradiction between Kahneman and Smith is actually deeply informative:

- **Individual irrationality doesn't necessarily mean market failure**: Markets aggregate information and create incentives that can partially correct individual biases. Competition punishes systematic errors
- **But markets don't always fix everything**: Bubbles, panics, and persistent mispricings show that collective irrationality can overwhelm market mechanisms
- **Context matters**: People make worse decisions when problems are unfamiliar, feedback is delayed, or stakes are abstract. Markets work best when rules are clear, feedback is immediate, and participants gain experience

Their 2002 Nobel Prize was awarded to Kahneman "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty" and to Smith "for having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you find $10 on the ground — you're happy! Now imagine you lose $10 from your pocket — you're really upset. But $10 is $10, right? Kahneman discovered that losing something hurts about twice as much as finding the same thing feels good. This explains a lot about why people make strange choices — like refusing a fair bet or keeping a toy they never play with just because it's "theirs." Now Smith did something different: he built pretend markets in a classroom, gave students fake money, and let them buy and sell. He was amazed to find that even though no student knew the "right" price, the market figured it out on its own — like magic. So people are bad at math in their heads, but when they trade together in a market, the group somehow gets it right.

## 对正统经济学的两重挑战

2002年诺贝尔奖由两位从相反方向挑战经济学的学者分享——他们得出了看似矛盾的结论。

卡尼曼，一位从未上过经济学课的心理学家，证明人们是系统性非理性的——容易受到偏差、错觉和错误的影响，违反理性选择理论的每一个假设。史密斯，一位建造实验室来检验市场理论的经济学家，证明市场往往运作得出奇地好——即使其中的人远非理论假设的理性主体。

这些发现之间的张力是现代经济学中最富成效的之一：个体是非理性的，但市场仍然可以是有效的。理解何时以及为什么，是行为经济学和实验经济学的前沿。

## 卡尼曼：前景理论与判断心理学

卡尼曼和特沃斯基（1996年去世，无法分享奖项）花了数十年记录人类判断如何系统性地偏离理性。他们的杰作是**前景理论**（1979年）——有史以来最有影响力的期望效用理论替代方案。

**前景理论**描述了人们在风险下实际如何做决策，与理性主体应该如何做形成对比：

- **参照依赖**：人们相对于参照点（通常是现状）评估结果，而非绝对值。如果你预期5万的薪水拿到6万感觉很好，但预期7万时拿到6万感觉很糟——尽管是同样的薪水
- **损失厌恶**：损失比收益感受更强烈。失去100元的痛苦大约是获得100元快乐的两倍。这一不对称性解释了大量行为——从为什么人们持有亏损股票太久到为什么他们拒绝有利的赌注
- **敏感度递减**：100元和200元之间的差异感觉比1100元和1200元之间的差异大。人们对参照点附近的变化敏感，但对更远处的变化越来越不敏感
- **概率加权**：人们过度加权小概率（解释了彩票和过度保险）并低估大概率（解释了阿莱发现的确定性效应）

## 认知偏差目录

除了前景理论，卡尼曼和特沃斯基记录了人类判断中的系统性偏差目录：

- **锚定效应**：人们的估计受到无关起始点的严重影响。先问"土耳其人口是多于还是少于500万？"再问"是多少？"——你得到的答案远低于锚定为6500万时
- **可得性启发**：人们通过例子浮现脑海的容易程度来判断事件概率。飞机失事感觉比车祸更可能，因为更令人印象深刻——尽管汽车危险得多
- **代表性启发**：人们通过相似性而非基础概率判断概率。一个安静、爱读书的人似乎更可能是图书管理员而非销售员——尽管销售员多得多
- **框架效应**：同一选择的不同描述产生不同决策。"90%存活率"听起来比"10%死亡率"好——尽管它们完全相同
- **过度自信**：人们系统性地高估自己的知识和能力。专家的校准往往并不比新手好
- **现状偏差**：人们不成比例地坚持默认选项，即使切换会更有利

这些不是随机错误——而是跨文化和情境预测行为的系统性模式。

## 史密斯：实验室作为经济风洞

卡尼曼证明个体是非理性的，而史密斯证明市场可以被检验——而且往往比任何人预期的都运作得好。

从1960年代开始，史密斯开创了**实验经济学**——将真人带入实验室，给他们真钱，让他们在受控的市场环境中交易。结果令人震惊：

- **市场收敛到均衡**：即使只有少数对供需理论一无所知的交易者，实验市场也能迅速收敛到理论预测的竞争均衡价格。亚当·斯密的看不见的手确实有效——即使参与者是不完美的、有限理性的人
- **制度很重要**：市场的规则——如何出价、如何揭示信息、如何执行交易——极大地影响结果。双向拍卖（买卖双方都可以报价）比标价市场更快收敛到均衡
- **泡沫可以被创造和研究**：史密斯创建了资产市场实验，泡沫可靠地形成和崩溃——提供了关于投机动态的受控证据，这在真实市场中无法研究
- **政策的风洞测试**：正如工程师在建造飞机前在风洞中测试设计，史密斯主张市场设计在实施前应在实验室中测试。这种方法被用于设计频谱拍卖、电力市场和排放交易系统

## 富有成效的张力

卡尼曼和史密斯之间的表面矛盾实际上极具启发性：

- **个体非理性不一定意味着市场失灵**：市场汇聚信息并创造激励，可以部分纠正个体偏差。竞争惩罚系统性错误
- **但市场并不总能修复一切**：泡沫、恐慌和持续的错误定价表明集体非理性可以压倒市场机制
- **情境很重要**：当问题不熟悉、反馈延迟或利害关系抽象时，人们做出更差的决策。当规则清晰、反馈即时、参与者积累经验时，市场运作最好

他们2002年的诺贝尔奖授予卡尼曼"因其将心理学研究的洞见整合到经济科学中，特别是关于不确定性下的人类判断和决策"，授予史密斯"因其将实验室实验确立为实证经济分析的工具"。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你在地上捡到10元——你很开心！现在想象你口袋里丢了10元——你非常难过。但10元就是10元，对吧？卡尼曼发现，失去某样东西的痛苦大约是得到同样东西的快乐的两倍。这解释了为什么人们做出奇怪的选择——比如拒绝公平的赌注，或者留着一个从不玩的玩具只因为它是"自己的"。而史密斯做了不同的事：他在教室里建了模拟市场，给学生假钱，让他们买卖。他惊讶地发现，虽然没有学生知道"正确"价格，市场自己就算出来了——像魔法一样。所以人们在脑子里算数很差，但当他们在市场中一起交易时，群体不知怎么就算对了。
