## The Revolution That Killed Keynesian Confidence

By the late 1960s, Keynesian economics seemed triumphant. Governments believed they could fine-tune the economy — a little more spending to reduce unemployment, a little less to control inflation. The Phillips curve promised a stable tradeoff: accept more inflation, get less unemployment. Policymakers just had to choose their preferred point on the curve.

Then the 1970s happened. Inflation and unemployment rose simultaneously — stagflation — something the Keynesian framework said couldn't happen. Robert Lucas explained why: **people aren't stupid.** They learn, they adapt, they anticipate. And when they anticipate government policy, the policy stops working.

This was the rational expectations revolution — and it demolished the intellectual foundations of postwar macroeconomic policy.

## Rational Expectations: People Use All Available Information

Before Lucas, macroeconomic models assumed people form expectations in simple, mechanical ways — "adaptive expectations" meant people just extrapolate from the recent past. If inflation was 3% last year, they expect 3% next year. They're always looking in the rearview mirror.

Lucas argued this was absurd. People have access to newspapers, economic data, and common sense. They understand — at least roughly — how the economy works. **Rational expectations** means:

- People use all available information, including knowledge of government policy, to form their expectations
- They don't make systematic errors — they may be wrong on any given occasion, but they're not predictably wrong in the same direction
- Their expectations are consistent with the actual model of the economy — they understand the structure they're operating in

This doesn't mean people are omniscient or that they never make mistakes. It means they don't make the same mistake over and over in a way that the government can systematically exploit.

## The Lucas Critique: Why Old Models Break

Lucas's most devastating contribution was the **Lucas critique** (1976) — a methodological argument that destroyed confidence in the large-scale econometric models used for policy analysis.

The argument: traditional models estimate statistical relationships from historical data — for example, the relationship between money supply growth and output growth. Policymakers then use these relationships to predict what will happen if they change policy. But here's the problem: **when policy changes, people's behavior changes too, and the statistical relationships shift.**

Example: the Phillips curve showed a historical correlation between inflation and unemployment. Policymakers concluded they could permanently reduce unemployment by accepting higher inflation. But when they tried, workers and firms anticipated the inflation, demanded higher wages, and raised prices accordingly. The Phillips curve shifted — more inflation bought no reduction in unemployment.

The Lucas critique says: **you cannot use historical statistical relationships to predict the effects of new policies, because those relationships are themselves products of the old policy regime.** Change the policy, change the behavior, change the relationships. Every econometric model built on historical correlations is unreliable for policy evaluation.

This wasn't just a theoretical point — it explained why Keynesian fine-tuning had failed in the 1970s and why the large-scale models had produced such poor forecasts.

## Policy Ineffectiveness and Its Limits

Lucas, together with Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace, derived the **policy ineffectiveness proposition**: if people have rational expectations and markets clear continuously, then anticipated monetary policy has no real effects. Only surprise policy moves — unanticipated changes in money supply — can temporarily affect output and employment.

The logic:

- The central bank announces it will increase the money supply by 5%
- Everyone expects 5% more money, so everyone raises prices by 5%
- Real variables (output, employment) don't change — only the price level rises
- Only if the central bank surprises people — printing 8% when they expected 5% — does the extra 3% temporarily boost output, because people mistake the general price increase for increased demand for their specific products

The implications were radical:

- **Systematic policy is impotent**: Any predictable, rule-based monetary policy is fully anticipated and has no real effects
- **Only surprises matter**: But a government that relies on surprises loses credibility, and people become harder to surprise
- **Rules beat discretion**: Since systematic policy can't improve outcomes and surprises are unsustainable, the best monetary policy is a transparent, credible rule — like inflation targeting

## Equilibrium Business Cycle Theory

Lucas also pioneered the **equilibrium approach to business cycles** — explaining recessions and booms without assuming market failures or price rigidities.

In Lucas's "island model," producers are scattered across isolated markets. Each producer observes their own price but can't immediately distinguish between:

- A rise in the general price level (inflation — no reason to produce more)
- A rise in the relative price of their product (increased demand — reason to produce more)

This **signal extraction problem** means that monetary shocks temporarily fool producers into changing output. When the central bank unexpectedly increases the money supply, producers see higher prices and mistakenly increase production — creating a temporary boom. When they realize it was just inflation, they cut back — creating a bust.

His 1995 Nobel Prize was awarded "for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and thereby having transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of economic policy."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine your teacher says: "If everyone gets an A on the test, I'll give the whole class a pizza party." So everyone studies hard and gets A's. Now the teacher says: "If everyone gets an A again, another pizza party." But this time, you know the trick — you study just enough to get the A, not more. The teacher can't keep motivating you the same way because you've figured out the pattern. That's what Lucas discovered about government policy. When the government tries the same trick twice — like printing more money to create jobs — people figure it out and adjust their behavior, so the trick stops working. The only way to surprise people is to do something unexpected — but then nobody trusts you anymore.

## 终结凯恩斯主义自信的革命

到1960年代末，凯恩斯经济学似乎大获全胜。政府相信他们可以微调经济——多花一点钱减少失业，少花一点控制通胀。菲利普斯曲线承诺了一个稳定的权衡：接受更多通胀，换取更少失业。政策制定者只需选择曲线上他们偏好的点。

然后1970年代来了。通胀和失业同时上升——滞胀——凯恩斯框架说这不可能发生。卢卡斯解释了原因：**人不是傻子。** 他们学习、适应、预期。当他们预期到政府政策时，政策就失效了。

这就是理性预期革命——它摧毁了战后宏观经济政策的智识基础。

---

## 理性预期：人们利用所有可用信息

在卢卡斯之前，宏观经济模型假设人们以简单、机械的方式形成预期——"适应性预期"意味着人们只是从近期过去外推。如果去年通胀是3%，他们预期明年也是3%。他们总是看后视镜。

卢卡斯认为这很荒谬。人们可以看报纸、经济数据，有常识。他们至少大致理解经济如何运作。**理性预期**意味着：

- 人们利用所有可用信息，包括对政府政策的了解，来形成预期
- 他们不会犯系统性错误——在任何特定场合可能犯错，但不会可预测地在同一方向上犯错
- 他们的预期与经济的实际模型一致——他们理解自己所处的结构

这不意味着人们无所不知或从不犯错。它意味着他们不会以政府可以系统性利用的方式反复犯同样的错误。

## 卢卡斯批判：为什么旧模型会崩溃

卢卡斯最具破坏力的贡献是**卢卡斯批判**（1976年）——一个方法论论证，摧毁了人们对用于政策分析的大型计量经济模型的信心。

论证如下：传统模型从历史数据中估计统计关系——例如货币供应增长与产出增长之间的关系。政策制定者然后用这些关系来预测改变政策会发生什么。但问题在于：**当政策改变时，人们的行为也会改变，统计关系也会移动。**

例子：菲利普斯曲线显示了通胀与失业之间的历史相关性。政策制定者得出结论，可以通过接受更高通胀来永久降低失业。但当他们尝试时，工人和企业预期到了通胀，要求更高工资，相应提高价格。菲利普斯曲线移动了——更多通胀没有换来失业的减少。

卢卡斯批判说：**你不能用历史统计关系来预测新政策的效果，因为那些关系本身就是旧政策体制的产物。** 改变政策，改变行为，改变关系。每个建立在历史相关性上的计量经济模型对政策评估都是不可靠的。

这不仅仅是理论观点——它解释了为什么凯恩斯式微调在1970年代失败了，以及为什么大型模型产生了如此糟糕的预测。

## 政策无效性及其局限

卢卡斯与萨金特和华莱士一起推导出**政策无效性命题**：如果人们有理性预期且市场持续出清，那么被预期到的货币政策没有实际效果。只有意外的政策行动——未被预期的货币供应变化——才能暂时影响产出和就业。

逻辑：

- 央行宣布将增加5%的货币供应
- 每个人都预期多5%的货币，所以每个人都将价格提高5%
- 实际变量（产出、就业）不变——只有价格水平上升
- 只有当央行出其不意——人们预期5%时印了8%——额外的3%才会暂时提振产出，因为人们将一般价格上涨误认为对其特定产品需求的增加

含义是激进的：

- **系统性政策是无力的**：任何可预测的、基于规则的货币政策都被完全预期，没有实际效果
- **只有意外才重要**：但依赖意外的政府会失去信誉，人们变得更难被出其不意
- **规则优于裁量**：既然系统性政策无法改善结果，意外又不可持续，最好的货币政策是透明、可信的规则——如通胀目标制

## 均衡商业周期理论

卢卡斯还开创了**商业周期的均衡方法**——在不假设市场失灵或价格刚性的情况下解释衰退和繁荣。

在卢卡斯的"孤岛模型"中，生产者分散在孤立的市场上。每个生产者观察到自己的价格，但无法立即区分：

- 一般价格水平的上升（通胀——没有理由多生产）
- 其产品相对价格的上升（需求增加——有理由多生产）

这个**信号提取问题**意味着货币冲击暂时欺骗了生产者，使其改变产出。当央行意外增加货币供应时，生产者看到更高的价格，错误地增加生产——创造了暂时的繁荣。当他们意识到这只是通胀时，他们削减产出——创造了衰退。

他1995年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其发展和应用了理性预期假说，从而改变了宏观经济分析并加深了我们对经济政策的理解。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你的老师说："如果所有人考试都得A，我就请全班吃披萨。"所以每个人都努力学习，都得了A。现在老师说："如果所有人再得A，再来一次披萨派对。"但这次你已经知道套路了——你只学到刚好得A就够了，不会更多。老师不能用同样的方式一直激励你，因为你已经看穿了规律。这就是卢卡斯对政府政策的发现。当政府第二次用同样的招数——比如印更多钱来创造就业——人们就会看穿并调整行为，招数就不管用了。唯一让人意外的方法是做出乎意料的事——但那样就没人信任你了。
