## The Economy Is Made of People

Macroeconomics deals in aggregates — GDP, total consumption, national savings. But these numbers are averages that hide enormous variation. When average income rises, who benefits? When a price increases, who suffers most? When a policy changes, which households are helped and which are hurt?

Angus Deaton spent his career insisting that to understand the economy, you must understand individual households. His work wove together three strands — how people allocate spending across goods, how consumption relates to income over time, and how to measure poverty and welfare in developing countries. By linking microeconomic data to macroeconomic questions, he transformed how economists think about consumption, inequality, and human well-being.

## The Almost Ideal Demand System

In 1980, Deaton (with John Muellbauer) created the **Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS)** — a model for understanding how consumers allocate their budgets across different goods.

The question sounds simple: when the price of food rises, how much less food do people buy, and what do they buy instead? But answering it rigorously requires a model that:

- Allows demand for each good to depend on the prices of all other goods
- Respects the budget constraint — spending on all goods must add up to total income
- Is flexible enough to fit real data without imposing unrealistic assumptions
- Can be estimated with available data

The AIDS model achieved all of this with an elegant mathematical structure. It became the standard tool worldwide for:

- **Tax policy**: When governments consider taxing food, fuel, or luxury goods, they need to know how consumers will respond. The AIDS model provides these estimates — and reveals that taxes on necessities hit the poor hardest
- **Trade policy**: When tariffs change, how do consumption patterns shift? The model traces the effects through the entire basket of goods
- **Welfare analysis**: By measuring how price changes affect different income groups differently, the model reveals who wins and who loses from policy changes

## The Consumption Puzzle: Micro vs. Macro

Deaton made a fundamental contribution to understanding the relationship between consumption and income — and exposed a deep tension between what individual data shows and what aggregate data shows.

**The permanent income hypothesis** (from Friedman's Nobel work) predicts that people smooth their consumption — they don't spend more just because this month's income is high, because they know income fluctuates. They consume based on their long-run average income.

Deaton tested this with household data and found a paradox:

- **At the individual level**: Consumption is too smooth relative to income — people smooth even more than the theory predicts. This is the **Deaton paradox** — if people are smoothing consumption based on permanent income, and income has a random walk component, consumption should be more volatile than it actually is
- **At the aggregate level**: Consumption tracks income too closely — it's not smooth enough. When national income rises, national consumption rises almost immediately

Deaton resolved this by showing that **aggregation changes everything**. Individual behavior and aggregate behavior follow different patterns because individual income shocks are partly idiosyncratic (they cancel out when you add up millions of people) and partly common (they affect everyone). You can't simply scale up individual behavior to predict aggregate outcomes — a lesson that reshaped macroeconomics.

## Measuring Poverty: The View from Below

Deaton's most impactful work may be his contributions to measuring poverty and welfare in developing countries. He insisted that poverty measurement must be grounded in what people actually consume — not what national accounts say they should consume.

**Household surveys as the foundation**:

- Deaton championed the use of detailed household surveys — asking families what they eat, what they spend, how they live — as the primary tool for understanding poverty
- He showed that national accounts data (GDP per capita) can be deeply misleading about living standards. In India, for example, national accounts suggested much higher consumption than household surveys revealed — a discrepancy with enormous policy implications
- His methods for designing and analyzing household surveys became the standard at the World Bank and development agencies worldwide

**Purchasing power parity and poverty lines**:

- Comparing poverty across countries requires converting incomes into comparable units. Deaton made fundamental contributions to **purchasing power parity (PPP)** — adjusting for the fact that the same dollar buys very different amounts in different countries
- He was deeply critical of global poverty counts that relied on crude PPP adjustments, showing that small methodological choices could move hundreds of millions of people above or below the poverty line — a sobering reminder that measurement is not neutral

**Health and well-being**:

- Deaton expanded the study of welfare beyond income to include health, nutrition, and subjective well-being
- His work on the relationship between income and health in developing countries showed that economic growth improves health — but the relationship is complex, mediated by public health infrastructure, education, and inequality
- With Daniel Kahneman, he studied the relationship between income and happiness in the United States, finding that emotional well-being rises with income up to about $75,000 per year, then plateaus — while life satisfaction continues to rise

His 2015 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you want to know if kids in your school are eating well. You could look at how much the school cafeteria spends on food — but that doesn't tell you who's eating what. Some kids might get lots of food while others get very little. Deaton said: don't just look at the total — go ask each kid what they actually ate for lunch. He invented a way to study what every family buys and eats, and used it to understand who's really poor and who's doing okay. He found that the big national numbers often hide the truth — a country can look richer on paper while many families are still struggling. His work helped governments figure out who actually needs help, instead of just guessing from averages.

## 经济由人组成

宏观经济学处理总量——GDP、总消费、国民储蓄。但这些数字是隐藏了巨大差异的平均值。当平均收入上升时，谁受益？当价格上涨时，谁受害最深？当政策改变时，哪些家庭得到帮助，哪些受到伤害？

迪顿毕生坚持：要理解经济，必须理解个体家庭。他的工作编织了三条线索——人们如何在不同商品间分配支出、消费如何随时间与收入相关、以及如何衡量发展中国家的贫困和福利。通过将微观经济数据与宏观经济问题联系起来，他改变了经济学家对消费、不平等和人类福祉的思考方式。

## 近乎理想的需求系统

1980年，迪顿（与穆尔鲍尔）创建了**近乎理想的需求系统（AIDS）**——一个理解消费者如何在不同商品间分配预算的模型。

问题听起来简单：当食品价格上涨时，人们少买多少食品，转而买什么？但严格回答需要一个模型：

- 允许每种商品的需求取决于所有其他商品的价格
- 尊重预算约束——所有商品的支出必须加总等于总收入
- 足够灵活以拟合真实数据而不施加不现实的假设
- 可以用可用数据估计

AIDS模型以优雅的数学结构实现了所有这些。它成为全球标准工具，用于：

- **税收政策**：当政府考虑对食品、燃料或奢侈品征税时，需要知道消费者如何反应。AIDS模型提供这些估计——并揭示对必需品征税对穷人打击最大
- **贸易政策**：当关税变化时，消费模式如何转变？模型追踪效应通过整个商品篮子
- **福利分析**：通过衡量价格变化如何不同地影响不同收入群体，模型揭示谁从政策变化中获益、谁受损

## 消费之谜：微观与宏观

迪顿对理解消费与收入之间的关系做出了基础性贡献——并揭示了个体数据显示的与总量数据显示的之间的深层张力。

**持久收入假说**（来自弗里德曼的诺贝尔工作）预测人们平滑消费——他们不会仅仅因为这个月收入高就多花钱，因为他们知道收入会波动。他们基于长期平均收入消费。

迪顿用家庭数据检验了这一点，发现了一个悖论：

- **在个体层面**：消费相对于收入过于平滑——人们的平滑程度超过理论预测。这就是**迪顿悖论**——如果人们基于持久收入平滑消费，而收入有随机游走成分，消费应该比实际更波动
- **在总量层面**：消费过于紧密地跟踪收入——不够平滑。当国民收入上升时，国民消费几乎立即上升

迪顿通过证明**加总改变一切**来解决这个问题。个体行为和总量行为遵循不同模式，因为个体收入冲击部分是特异性的（当你加总数百万人时它们相互抵消）部分是共同的（影响每个人）。你不能简单地将个体行为放大来预测总量结果——这一教训重塑了宏观经济学。

## 衡量贫困：自下而上的视角

迪顿最具影响力的工作可能是他对发展中国家贫困和福利衡量的贡献。他坚持贫困衡量必须基于人们实际消费的东西——而非国民账户说他们应该消费的。

**家庭调查作为基础**：

- 迪顿倡导使用详细的家庭调查——询问家庭吃什么、花什么、如何生活——作为理解贫困的主要工具
- 他证明国民账户数据（人均GDP）可能严重误导生活水平。例如在印度，国民账户显示的消费远高于家庭调查揭示的——一个具有巨大政策含义的差异
- 他设计和分析家庭调查的方法成为世界银行和发展机构的标准

**购买力平价与贫困线**：

- 跨国比较贫困需要将收入转换为可比单位。迪顿对**购买力平价（PPP）**做出了基础性贡献——调整同一美元在不同国家购买力差异的事实
- 他深刻批评了依赖粗糙PPP调整的全球贫困统计，证明小的方法论选择可以将数亿人移到贫困线之上或之下——一个令人警醒的提醒：衡量不是中性的

**健康与福祉**：

- 迪顿将福利研究从收入扩展到健康、营养和主观幸福感
- 他关于发展中国家收入与健康关系的工作表明经济增长改善健康——但关系是复杂的，受公共卫生基础设施、教育和不平等的中介
- 与卡尼曼合作，他研究了美国收入与幸福的关系，发现情感幸福感随收入上升到约7.5万美元后趋于平稳——而生活满意度继续上升

他2015年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对消费、贫困和福利的分析。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你想知道学校里的孩子们是否吃得好。你可以看食堂花了多少钱买食物——但这不能告诉你谁吃了什么。有些孩子可能吃了很多，而其他孩子吃得很少。迪顿说：不要只看总数——去问每个孩子午餐实际吃了什么。他发明了一种方法来研究每个家庭买什么、吃什么，并用它来理解谁真正贫穷、谁过得还行。他发现大的国家数字经常隐藏真相——一个国家在纸面上可能看起来更富裕，而许多家庭仍在挣扎。他的工作帮助政府弄清楚谁真正需要帮助，而不是仅仅从平均数猜测。
