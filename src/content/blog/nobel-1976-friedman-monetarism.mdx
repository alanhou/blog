## Inflation Is Always and Everywhere a Monetary Phenomenon

Few economists have shaped both academic thought and real-world policy as profoundly as Milton Friedman. In an era when Keynesian economics dominated — when governments believed they could fine-tune the economy through spending and taxation — Friedman mounted a counter-revolution. His message was simple and powerful: **money matters**. Control the money supply, and you control inflation. Try to do too much with government policy, and you'll make things worse.

His work spanned three interconnected domains — how people consume, how money drives the economy, and why stabilization policy is harder than politicians think — each of which alone would have been a career-defining achievement.

## The Permanent Income Hypothesis: Why People Don't Spend Like Keynes Thought

Keynes argued that consumption depends on current income: earn more today, spend more today. This implied that government stimulus — putting money in people's pockets — would immediately boost spending and revive a sluggish economy.

Friedman disagreed. In *A Theory of the Consumption Function* (1957), he proposed the **permanent income hypothesis**: people base their spending not on what they earn this month, but on what they expect to earn on average over their lifetime — their "permanent income."

- A one-time bonus doesn't change your lifestyle — you save most of it
- A permanent raise does — you adjust your spending upward
- Temporary tax cuts have less impact than Keynesians predicted, because people recognize them as temporary and save rather than spend

This insight had profound policy implications: short-term fiscal stimulus is far less effective than Keynesians believed. People are smarter and more forward-looking than simple models assumed.

## Monetary History: The Fed Caused the Great Depression

Friedman's most explosive work was *A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960* (1963), co-authored with Anna Schwartz. Through meticulous historical analysis, they argued that the Great Depression was not an inevitable failure of capitalism — it was a catastrophic policy error by the Federal Reserve.

The Fed allowed the money supply to collapse by one-third between 1929 and 1933. Banks failed in waves, credit dried up, and the economy spiraled downward. The Depression wasn't proof that markets fail — it was proof that bad monetary policy can destroy an economy.

From this historical foundation, Friedman built **monetarism**:

- **The quantity theory of money (restated)**: In the long run, the price level is determined by the money supply. Double the money, and you eventually double prices. "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"
- **Short-run real effects**: In the short run, changes in money supply affect real output and employment — but these effects are temporary and unpredictable in their timing ("long and variable lags")
- **The K-percent rule**: Since fine-tuning is impossible, the central bank should simply increase the money supply at a fixed annual rate (say 3–5%) matching long-run economic growth — no discretion, no guessing, just a steady rule

## The Natural Rate and the Death of the Phillips Curve

In his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association, Friedman delivered another intellectual bombshell. The prevailing orthodoxy held that governments faced a stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment — the Phillips curve. Want less unemployment? Accept more inflation. It was a menu of choices.

Friedman argued this trade-off was an illusion:

- There exists a **natural rate of unemployment** determined by real factors — labor market structure, information costs, mobility — that monetary policy cannot permanently change
- If the government tries to push unemployment below the natural rate by printing money, it works temporarily — but only because workers are fooled by inflation they didn't expect
- Once people adjust their expectations, unemployment returns to the natural rate, but now with higher inflation. Push again, and you get even higher inflation for the same unemployment — **stagflation**
- The long-run Phillips curve is vertical: there is no permanent trade-off

The 1970s stagflation — simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment — vindicated Friedman's prediction spectacularly, discrediting the Keynesian consensus and reshaping central banking worldwide.

## The Complexity of Stabilization Policy

Friedman's third major contribution was demonstrating why government attempts to stabilize the economy often backfire:

- **Long and variable lags**: Monetary policy takes 6–18 months to affect the economy, but the timing is unpredictable. By the time a stimulus kicks in, the recession may be over and the stimulus becomes inflationary
- **Information problems**: Policymakers don't know the current state of the economy in real time — data arrives with delays and gets revised
- **Political incentives**: Politicians prefer short-term booms before elections, creating a political business cycle that destabilizes rather than stabilizes

The conclusion: discretionary policy does more harm than good. Rules beat discretion. This argument transformed central banking — leading eventually to inflation targeting, central bank independence, and the rules-based frameworks that dominate monetary policy today.

His 1976 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine your parents give you pocket money. Keynes said: if they give you extra this week, you'll spend it all right away. Friedman said: no — kids are smarter than that. If it's a one-time gift, you'll save most of it. You only spend more when you believe the extra money will keep coming. And if your parents just keep printing play money to make you feel richer? Eventually you'll realize the money is worth less, and nothing real has changed — except now all the prices in your pretend store are higher.

## 通货膨胀在任何时候任何地方都是一种货币现象

很少有经济学家能像弗里德曼那样深刻地同时塑造学术思想和现实政策。在凯恩斯主义主导的时代——政府相信可以通过支出和税收精细调控经济——弗里德曼发起了一场反革命。他的信息简单而有力：**货币至关重要**。控制货币供应量，就能控制通胀。试图用政府政策做太多事，只会让情况更糟。

他的工作横跨三个相互关联的领域——人们如何消费、货币如何驱动经济、以及为什么稳定政策比政客想象的更难——其中任何一个单独拿出来都足以定义一个职业生涯。

---

## 持久收入假说：人们不像凯恩斯认为的那样花钱

凯恩斯认为消费取决于当期收入：今天赚得多，今天就花得多。这意味着政府刺激——把钱放进人们口袋——会立即提振消费，复苏低迷的经济。

弗里德曼不同意。在《消费函数理论》（1957年）中，他提出了**持久收入假说**：人们的消费不是基于这个月赚了多少，而是基于他们预期一生中平均能赚多少——即"持久收入"。

- 一次性奖金不会改变你的生活方式——你会把大部分存起来
- 永久性加薪才会——你会相应调高消费
- 临时减税的效果远不如凯恩斯主义者预测的那么大，因为人们认识到它是临时的，会储蓄而非消费

这一洞见具有深远的政策含义：短期财政刺激远不如凯恩斯主义者所相信的那样有效。人们比简单模型假设的更聪明、更有远见。

## 货币史：美联储导致了大萧条

弗里德曼最具爆炸性的著作是与安娜·施瓦茨合著的《美国货币史，1867–1960》（1963年）。通过细致的历史分析，他们论证大萧条不是资本主义的必然失败——而是美联储的灾难性政策错误。

美联储在1929年到1933年间任由货币供应量萎缩了三分之一。银行成批倒闭，信贷枯竭，经济螺旋式下坠。大萧条不是市场失灵的证据——而是糟糕的货币政策可以摧毁经济的证据。

在这一历史基础上，弗里德曼构建了**货币主义**：

- **货币数量论（重述）**：长期来看，价格水平由货币供应量决定。货币翻倍，价格最终翻倍。"通货膨胀在任何时候任何地方都是一种货币现象"
- **短期实际效应**：短期内，货币供应量的变化会影响实际产出和就业——但这些效应是暂时的，且时滞不可预测（"长期且可变的时滞"）
- **K百分比规则**：既然精细调控不可能，央行应该简单地以与长期经济增长匹配的固定年率（比如3–5%）增加货币供应量——不需要自由裁量，不需要猜测，只需要一个稳定的规则

## 自然失业率与菲利普斯曲线之死

在1967年美国经济学会主席演讲中，弗里德曼投下了另一颗智识炸弹。当时的正统观点认为，政府面临通胀与失业之间的稳定权衡——菲利普斯曲线。想要更低的失业率？接受更高的通胀。这是一份选择菜单。

弗里德曼论证这种权衡是幻觉：

- 存在一个由实际因素——劳动力市场结构、信息成本、流动性——决定的**自然失业率**，货币政策无法永久改变它
- 如果政府试图通过印钞将失业率压低到自然率以下，短期内有效——但仅仅因为工人被他们没有预期到的通胀所欺骗
- 一旦人们调整了预期，失业率回到自然率，但现在伴随着更高的通胀。再次推动，你会得到更高的通胀却换来同样的失业率——**滞胀**
- 长期菲利普斯曲线是垂直的：不存在永久的权衡

1970年代的滞胀——高通胀与高失业并存——壮观地验证了弗里德曼的预测，瓦解了凯恩斯主义共识，重塑了全球央行实践。

## 稳定政策的复杂性

弗里德曼的第三大贡献是论证了为什么政府稳定经济的尝试往往适得其反：

- **长期且可变的时滞**：货币政策需要6–18个月才能影响经济，但时机不可预测。等刺激生效时，衰退可能已经结束，刺激反而变成了通胀推手
- **信息问题**：决策者无法实时了解经济的当前状态——数据有延迟且会被修正
- **政治激励**：政客偏好选举前的短期繁荣，制造出政治性经济周期，不是稳定经济而是破坏稳定

结论：自由裁量的政策弊大于利。规则优于裁量。这一论证改变了央行实践——最终催生了通胀目标制、央行独立性和当今主导货币政策的规则化框架。

他1976年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其在消费分析、货币历史与理论方面的成就，以及对稳定政策复杂性的论证。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你的父母给你零花钱。凯恩斯说：如果他们这周多给你一些，你会马上全花掉。弗里德曼说：不——孩子比那聪明。如果是一次性的礼物，你会把大部分存起来。只有当你相信额外的钱会持续给下去时，你才会多花。而如果你的父母只是不停地印游戏币让你觉得更富有呢？最终你会发现钱变得不值钱了，什么真实的东西都没变——只是你假装商店里的所有价格都变高了。
