## Politicians Are People Too

Economics assumes that consumers maximize utility and firms maximize profit. But when the same economists analyze government, they suddenly assume politicians maximize the public interest. Why the double standard?

James Buchanan asked this devastating question and spent his career answering it. His insight was simple but revolutionary: **apply the same behavioral assumptions to political actors as to economic actors**. Politicians maximize votes, not welfare. Bureaucrats maximize budgets, not efficiency. Voters are rationally ignorant, not perfectly informed citizens. Once you see politics through this lens, government failure becomes as predictable as market failure — and often harder to fix.

This was **public choice theory** — and it changed how we think about democracy, regulation, taxation, and the constitution itself.

## The Calculus of Consent: A Constitution for Rational People

Buchanan's foundational work, *The Calculus of Consent* (1962, with Gordon Tullock), asked a question no economist had seriously tackled: **what rules would rational, self-interested people agree to before they know their position in society?**

This is the constitutional stage — choosing the rules of the game before the game begins:

- **Unanimity as the ideal**: If a rule requires everyone's consent, no one can be exploited. But unanimity is costly — decision-making takes forever
- **Majority rule as a compromise**: We accept majority rule not because it's perfect, but because it balances the costs of being outvoted (external costs) against the costs of reaching agreement (decision-making costs)
- **Constitutional constraints**: Rational people would agree to limit what majorities can do — protecting individual rights, requiring supermajorities for fundamental changes, separating powers — because anyone might end up in the minority

This framework provided the first economic theory of constitutions — explaining why democratic societies adopt the rules they do, and why those rules matter more than any particular policy.

## Government Failure: The Mirror Image of Market Failure

Traditional economics identified market failures — monopoly, externalities, public goods — and prescribed government intervention as the cure. Buchanan asked: what if the cure is as sick as the patient?

Public choice theory identified systematic **government failures**:

- **Rational ignorance**: Voters have little incentive to become informed about policy. The cost of learning about trade policy exceeds any individual's benefit from voting wisely. So voters remain rationally ignorant — and politicians exploit this
- **Concentrated benefits, dispersed costs**: A tariff that gives $10 million to 100 steel producers costs 300 million consumers 5 cents each. The producers lobby fiercely; the consumers don't notice. The tariff passes — even though it destroys more value than it creates
- **Rent-seeking**: Instead of creating wealth, individuals and firms spend resources competing for government favors — subsidies, regulations that block competitors, exclusive licenses. These resources are wasted from society's perspective
- **Bureaucratic empire-building**: Bureaucrats maximize their budgets and staff, not the efficiency of public services. Larger budgets mean more power, higher salaries, and more prestige — regardless of whether the public benefits
- **Logrolling**: Legislators trade votes — "I'll support your bridge if you support my subsidy" — producing a collection of projects that no majority would support as a package, but each passes through vote-trading
- **The deficit bias**: Politicians prefer spending (which wins votes) over taxing (which loses votes), creating a systematic bias toward budget deficits and growing public debt

## Constitutional Political Economy

Buchanan's deepest contribution was shifting the focus from policy to rules — from "what should the government do?" to "what rules should constrain what the government can do?"

Key principles:

- **Politics without romance**: Don't design institutions assuming angels will run them. Design them assuming self-interested humans will — because they will
- **Rules over discretion**: Good outcomes depend less on good leaders than on good rules. A balanced budget amendment constrains all future politicians, regardless of their intentions
- **The generality principle**: Laws should apply equally to everyone — including the lawmakers. When legislators can exempt themselves from the rules they impose, abuse is inevitable
- **Fiscal constitution**: Buchanan advocated constitutional limits on taxation, spending, and borrowing — not because government is always bad, but because the political process systematically produces too much of it

## The Wicksellian Connection

Buchanan traced his intellectual roots to the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell, who argued in 1896 that taxation and spending should require near-unanimous consent — because any expenditure that truly benefits everyone should be able to command broad support. If a program can only pass by majority vote over strong opposition, it probably benefits some at the expense of others.

This Wicksellian insight — that the legitimacy of collective action depends on the consent of those affected — became the ethical foundation of Buchanan's entire program.

His 1986 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making."

## Explain It to a Child

> When you study how a candy store works, you assume the owner wants to make money — not give away free candy. But when people study government, they often assume politicians just want to help everyone. Buchanan said: wait — politicians want to win elections, just like store owners want to make money. Once you understand that, you can design better rules. It's like writing the rules of a board game: you don't assume everyone will play fair — you write rules that work even when people try to win.

## 政客也是人

经济学假设消费者最大化效用，企业最大化利润。但当同样的经济学家分析政府时，他们突然假设政客最大化公共利益。为什么要双重标准？

布坎南提出了这个致命的问题，并用毕生精力来回答它。他的洞见简单却具有革命性：**对政治行为者应用与经济行为者相同的行为假设**。政客最大化选票，而非福利。官僚最大化预算，而非效率。选民是理性无知的，而非完全知情的公民。一旦你透过这个镜头看政治，政府失灵就变得和市场失灵一样可预测——而且往往更难修复。

这就是**公共选择理论**——它改变了我们对民主、监管、税收和宪法本身的思考方式。

---

## 同意的计算：理性人的宪法

布坎南的奠基之作《同意的计算》（1962年，与戈登·塔洛克合著）提出了一个经济学家从未认真探讨的问题：**理性的、自利的人在不知道自己社会地位的情况下，会同意什么规则？**

这是宪法阶段——在博弈开始之前选择博弈规则：

- **一致同意作为理想**：如果一项规则需要所有人同意，就没有人会被剥削。但一致同意成本高昂——决策永远做不完
- **多数规则作为折中**：我们接受多数规则不是因为它完美，而是因为它平衡了被否决的成本（外部成本）和达成一致的成本（决策成本）
- **宪法约束**：理性的人会同意限制多数人能做什么——保护个人权利、要求根本性变革需要绝对多数、分权——因为任何人都可能成为少数派

这一框架提供了第一个关于宪法的经济理论——解释了民主社会为何采用它们所采用的规则，以及为什么这些规则比任何具体政策都重要。

## 政府失灵：市场失灵的镜像

传统经济学识别了市场失灵——垄断、外部性、公共品——并开出政府干预的药方。布坎南问：如果药方和疾病一样有问题呢？

公共选择理论识别了系统性的**政府失灵**：

- **理性无知**：选民几乎没有动力去了解政策。学习贸易政策的成本超过了任何个人明智投票的收益。所以选民保持理性无知——而政客利用这一点
- **集中的收益，分散的成本**：一项给100个钢铁生产商带来1000万美元的关税，让3亿消费者每人多付5分钱。生产商拼命游说；消费者毫无察觉。关税通过了——尽管它摧毁的价值多于创造的
- **寻租**：个人和企业不是创造财富，而是花费资源争夺政府恩惠——补贴、阻止竞争者的法规、独家许可。这些资源从社会角度看是浪费的
- **官僚帝国建设**：官僚最大化他们的预算和人员，而非公共服务的效率。更大的预算意味着更多权力、更高薪水和更多声望——无论公众是否受益
- **互投赞成票**：立法者交换选票——"我支持你的桥梁，你支持我的补贴"——产生一系列作为整体没有多数人会支持的项目，但每个项目都通过选票交易获得通过
- **赤字偏好**：政客偏好支出（赢得选票）而非征税（失去选票），造成系统性的预算赤字偏向和不断增长的公共债务

## 宪政政治经济学

布坎南最深刻的贡献是将焦点从政策转向规则——从"政府应该做什么？"转向"什么规则应该约束政府能做什么？"

核心原则：

- **没有浪漫的政治**：不要假设天使会管理制度来设计制度。假设自利的人会管理——因为事实就是如此
- **规则优于裁量**：好的结果更多取决于好的规则而非好的领导者。平衡预算修正案约束所有未来的政客，无论他们的意图如何
- **普遍性原则**：法律应平等适用于所有人——包括立法者。当立法者可以将自己豁免于他们施加的规则之外时，滥权就不可避免
- **财政宪法**：布坎南主张对税收、支出和借贷设定宪法限制——不是因为政府总是坏的，而是因为政治过程系统性地产生过多的政府

## 维克塞尔的联系

布坎南将自己的学术根源追溯到瑞典经济学家维克塞尔。维克塞尔在1896年论证，税收和支出应该要求接近一致的同意——因为任何真正惠及所有人的支出都应该能获得广泛支持。如果一个项目只能在强烈反对下通过多数票，它很可能是以牺牲一些人为代价惠及另一些人。

这一维克塞尔式洞见——集体行动的合法性取决于受影响者的同意——成为布坎南整个研究纲领的伦理基础。

他1986年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对经济和政治决策理论的契约和宪法基础的发展。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 当你研究一家糖果店如何运作时，你假设店主想赚钱——而不是免费送糖果。但当人们研究政府时，他们常常假设政客只想帮助所有人。布坎南说：等等——政客想赢得选举，就像店主想赚钱一样。一旦你理解了这一点，你就能设计更好的规则。这就像编写桌游规则：你不假设每个人都会公平游戏——你编写即使人们试图赢也能运作的规则。
