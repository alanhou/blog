## The Invisible Architecture of the Economy

Contracts are everywhere. Your employment agreement, your mortgage, your insurance policy, the terms of service you never read — all are contracts that shape behavior, allocate risk, and create incentives. The modern economy runs on contracts.

But writing good contracts is hard. Two fundamental problems make it so: you can't always observe what the other party does (moral hazard), and you can't anticipate everything that might happen (incompleteness). The 2016 Nobel Prize honored two economists who built the theory for dealing with both problems.

Bengt Holmström showed how to design optimal contracts when you can't observe effort — solving the principal-agent problem that underlies everything from CEO compensation to insurance design. Oliver Hart showed what happens when contracts are inevitably incomplete — and proved that the allocation of ownership and control rights is the key to making incomplete contracts work.

## Holmström: Optimal Incentive Contracts

The **principal-agent problem**: A company (the principal) hires a CEO (the agent) to run the business. The company wants the CEO to work hard and make good decisions. But it can't directly observe the CEO's effort — only the results, which depend on both effort and luck.

How should the company design the CEO's compensation?

Holmström's **informativeness principle** (1979) provided the foundational answer: **the optimal contract should tie pay to any measure that provides information about the agent's effort — and only to such measures.**

- If the company's stock price reflects the CEO's effort (plus noise), tie pay to stock price
- If the industry's overall performance is just noise (luck), filter it out — pay the CEO based on performance relative to industry peers, not absolute performance
- If a colleague's output provides information about shared conditions (luck vs. effort), use it as a benchmark

This principle has profound implications:

- **Stock options for executives**: Tying CEO pay to stock price makes sense — but only if you also adjust for market-wide movements. A CEO who rides a bull market shouldn't be rewarded for luck
- **Relative performance evaluation**: Comparing a manager's results to peers in the same industry filters out common shocks and provides a cleaner signal of effort
- **Team incentives**: When individual contributions can't be separated, group bonuses may be optimal — even though they create free-rider problems

## Holmström: Beyond Simple Incentives

Holmström extended the basic model in several crucial directions:

**The multitask problem** (1991): Most jobs involve multiple tasks. A teacher must both teach well and do paperwork. A doctor must both treat patients and keep records. If you reward only the measurable task (test scores, paperwork), the agent neglects the unmeasurable one (inspiring students, bedside manner).

- This explains why many jobs use flat salaries rather than performance pay — when important dimensions of the job are hard to measure, strong incentives on measurable dimensions distort effort away from unmeasurable ones
- It explains why government employees are often paid fixed salaries — their jobs involve too many dimensions to incentivize with simple metrics

**Career concerns** (1982/1999): Even without explicit incentive contracts, people work hard because the market is watching. A young lawyer works long hours not because of this year's bonus, but because good performance today leads to better job offers tomorrow. Holmström formalized this insight and showed that career concerns can substitute for — or complement — explicit contracts.

**Pay for luck**: Holmström's theory predicts that optimal contracts should filter out luck. But empirical evidence shows that CEOs are often rewarded for industry-wide booms they didn't cause. This gap between theory and practice became a major topic in corporate governance research.

## Hart: Incomplete Contracts and the Boundaries of the Firm

Oliver Hart tackled a different question: **what happens when you can't write a complete contract?**

Real contracts are always incomplete. You can't specify what should happen in every possible future state of the world. Your employment contract doesn't say what happens if your company is hit by a pandemic, or if AI makes your job obsolete, or if your boss asks you to do something not in your job description.

When contracts are incomplete, **who has the right to decide** in situations not covered by the contract? Hart's answer: **ownership.**

The **property rights theory** (with Sanford Grossman and John Moore):

- When a contract doesn't specify what happens, the owner of the asset gets to decide — this is **residual control rights**
- Ownership matters because it determines bargaining power. If you own the factory, you can threaten to fire the workers and hire new ones. If workers own unique skills, they can threaten to leave
- The optimal allocation of ownership gives control rights to the party whose investment is most important and hardest to contract on

This framework answers fundamental questions:

- **Why do firms exist?** When two parties' investments are complementary and hard to specify in a contract, merging into one firm (giving one party ownership) can be more efficient than contracting at arm's length
- **Make or buy?** A company should own its supplier when the supplier's investments are specific to the relationship and hard to protect contractually
- **Public vs. private provision**: Should prisons be public or private? Hart showed that private prisons have strong incentives to cut costs — but this includes cutting quality (guard training, inmate welfare) in ways that are hard to specify in a contract. When quality is hard to contract on, public provision may be better
- **Financial contracting**: Hart's theory explains why debt and equity have different control rights — creditors get control when the firm can't pay (bankruptcy), while shareholders control when things go well

## The Complete Picture

Holmström and Hart address two sides of the same coin:

- **Holmström**: When you can write a contract but can't observe effort, design incentives carefully — tie pay to informative signals, beware of multitasking distortions, and use career concerns
- **Hart**: When you can't write a complete contract at all, allocate ownership and control rights to the party whose uncontractible investments matter most

Their 2016 Nobel Prize was awarded "for their contributions to contract theory."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you hire your friend to walk your dog while you're on vacation. Problem one: you can't watch — how do you make sure they actually walk the dog and don't just sit on the couch? Holmström says: check clues. If the dog is tired and happy when you get back, that's a good sign. Pay your friend based on how the dog seems, not just whether they say they walked it. Problem two: what if something unexpected happens — the dog gets sick, or there's a snowstorm? You didn't plan for that in your deal. Hart says: whoever "owns" the responsibility should get to make decisions when surprises happen. If you gave your friend the house key and full responsibility, they decide whether to take the dog to the vet. The key insight: you need both good incentives AND clear rules about who decides when the plan doesn't cover everything.

## 经济的隐形架构

合同无处不在。你的雇佣协议、抵押贷款、保险单、你从未阅读的服务条款——都是塑造行为、分配风险和创造激励的合同。现代经济运行在合同之上。

但编写好的合同很难。两个根本性问题使其如此：你不能总是观察到对方做了什么（道德风险），你不能预见所有可能发生的事情（不完全性）。2016年诺贝尔奖表彰了两位为处理这两个问题构建理论的经济学家。

霍尔姆斯特伦展示了当你无法观察努力时如何设计最优合同——解决了从CEO薪酬到保险设计背后的委托-代理问题。哈特展示了当合同不可避免地不完全时会发生什么——并证明所有权和控制权的分配是使不完全合同运作的关键。

## 霍尔姆斯特伦：最优激励合同

**委托-代理问题**：一家公司（委托人）雇用CEO（代理人）经营业务。公司希望CEO努力工作并做出好决策。但它不能直接观察CEO的努力——只能看到结果，而结果取决于努力和运气。

公司应该如何设计CEO的薪酬？

霍尔姆斯特伦的**信息量原则**（1979年）提供了基础性答案：**最优合同应将薪酬与任何提供代理人努力信息的指标挂钩——且仅与此类指标挂钩。**

- 如果公司股价反映了CEO的努力（加上噪声），将薪酬与股价挂钩
- 如果行业整体表现只是噪声（运气），将其过滤掉——根据相对于行业同行的表现而非绝对表现支付CEO
- 如果同事的产出提供了关于共同条件（运气vs.努力）的信息，将其用作基准

这一原则有深远含义：

- **高管股票期权**：将CEO薪酬与股价挂钩是合理的——但前提是你也调整了市场整体波动。搭上牛市顺风车的CEO不应因运气而获得奖励
- **相对绩效评估**：将经理的业绩与同行业同行比较，过滤掉共同冲击，提供更清晰的努力信号
- **团队激励**：当个人贡献无法分离时，团体奖金可能是最优的——尽管它们创造了搭便车问题

## 霍尔姆斯特伦：超越简单激励

霍尔姆斯特伦在几个关键方向上扩展了基本模型：

**多任务问题**（1991年）：大多数工作涉及多项任务。教师必须既教好书又做文书工作。医生必须既治疗病人又保持记录。如果你只奖励可衡量的任务（考试成绩、文书工作），代理人就会忽视不可衡量的任务（激励学生、床边关怀）。

- 这解释了为什么许多工作使用固定工资而非绩效薪酬——当工作的重要维度难以衡量时，对可衡量维度的强激励会扭曲努力方向，远离不可衡量的维度
- 这解释了为什么政府雇员通常领取固定工资——他们的工作涉及太多维度，无法用简单指标激励

**职业关切**（1982/1999年）：即使没有明确的激励合同，人们也会努力工作，因为市场在观察。年轻律师长时间工作不是因为今年的奖金，而是因为今天的好表现会带来明天更好的工作机会。霍尔姆斯特伦形式化了这一洞见，并证明职业关切可以替代或补充明确合同。

**为运气付费**：霍尔姆斯特伦的理论预测最优合同应过滤掉运气。但实证证据表明CEO经常因他们没有造成的行业繁荣而获得奖励。理论与实践之间的差距成为公司治理研究的重要课题。

## 哈特：不完全合同与企业边界

哈特解决了一个不同的问题：**当你无法编写完全合同时会发生什么？**

真实合同总是不完全的。你不能指定在世界每种可能的未来状态下应该发生什么。你的雇佣合同没有说如果公司遭遇疫情会怎样，或者如果AI使你的工作过时会怎样，或者如果老板要求你做职位描述之外的事会怎样。

当合同不完全时，**谁有权在合同未涵盖的情况下做决定？** 哈特的答案：**所有权。**

**产权理论**（与格罗斯曼和摩尔合作）：

- 当合同没有规定发生什么时，资产的所有者有权决定——这就是**剩余控制权**
- 所有权很重要，因为它决定了谈判力量。如果你拥有工厂，你可以威胁解雇工人并雇用新人。如果工人拥有独特技能，他们可以威胁离开
- 最优的所有权分配将控制权给予投资最重要且最难通过合同保护的一方

这一框架回答了根本性问题：

- **企业为什么存在？** 当双方的投资互补且难以在合同中规定时，合并为一家企业（给予一方所有权）可能比保持距离签约更有效率
- **自制还是外购？** 当供应商的投资专用于该关系且难以通过合同保护时，公司应该拥有其供应商
- **公共vs.私人提供**：监狱应该是公立还是私立？哈特证明私人监狱有强烈的降低成本激励——但这包括以难以在合同中规定的方式降低质量（警卫培训、囚犯福利）。当质量难以通过合同约定时，公共提供可能更好
- **金融合同**：哈特的理论解释了为什么债务和股权有不同的控制权——债权人在企业无法支付时获得控制权（破产），而股东在一切顺利时控制

## 完整图景

霍尔姆斯特伦和哈特处理同一枚硬币的两面：

- **霍尔姆斯特伦**：当你能写合同但无法观察努力时，仔细设计激励——将薪酬与信息性信号挂钩，警惕多任务扭曲，利用职业关切
- **哈特**：当你根本无法写完全合同时，将所有权和控制权分配给不可合同化投资最重要的一方

他们2016年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对契约理论的贡献。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你雇朋友在你度假时遛狗。问题一：你看不到——你怎么确保他们真的遛了狗而不是坐在沙发上？霍尔姆斯特伦说：检查线索。如果你回来时狗又累又开心，那是好迹象。根据狗的状态付钱给朋友，而不仅仅是他们说遛了。问题二：如果发生了意外——狗生病了，或者下暴风雪了？你们的约定没有计划到这些。哈特说：谁"拥有"责任，谁就应该在意外发生时做决定。如果你给了朋友房子钥匙和全部责任，他们决定是否带狗去看兽医。关键洞见：你既需要好的激励，也需要关于计划没有涵盖的情况下谁来决定的明确规则。
