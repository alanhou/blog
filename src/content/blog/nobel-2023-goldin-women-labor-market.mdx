## The Question That Wouldn't Go Away

Women now earn university degrees at higher rates than men. They enter the workforce in nearly equal numbers. They are lawyers, doctors, executives, engineers. Yet in every country on earth, women earn less than men — in the United States, about 13% less on average.

Why? The obvious answer — discrimination — is part of the story but far from the whole story. If employers were simply paying women less for identical work, competition would eliminate the gap: firms that hired underpriced women would outperform those that didn't. Something deeper and more structural must be at work.

Claudia Goldin spent her career assembling the answer. By mining 200 years of U.S. data — census records, tax files, surveys, institutional archives — she traced the entire history of women's economic participation and identified the forces that have shaped, closed, widened, and stubbornly maintained the gender gap at each stage. Her story is not the one most people expect.

## The U-Shaped Curve: A Surprise in the Archives

The conventional narrative says women's work has been a story of steady progress — from housewives to workers, from exclusion to inclusion, climbing ever upward.

Goldin found the opposite. Female labor force participation over the past 200 years follows a **U-shaped curve**:

- **Agricultural era (early 1800s)**: Women worked extensively — on farms, in family businesses, in cottage industries. Their labor was economically essential, even if it wasn't always recorded
- **Industrialization (mid-1800s to early 1900s)**: As production moved from homes to factories, women's labor force participation **declined**. Factory work was physically demanding, socially stigmatized for married women, and increasingly separated from the home. As male wages rose, families could "afford" to have wives stay home. Social norms hardened: a working wife signaled that her husband couldn't provide
- **Service economy (early 1900s onward)**: As the economy shifted toward clerical, administrative, and professional work, women's participation began to **rise again**. Office work was cleaner, safer, and more compatible with social expectations. Education expanded. The curve turned upward

This U-shape was invisible until Goldin dug into the archives. Previous researchers had massively **undercounted women's work** in the nineteenth century because census takers didn't record unpaid farm labor, family business work, or piecework done at home. Goldin showed that women at the end of the 1890s were employed at nearly **three times** the rate that census data suggested. The "rise" of women's work in the twentieth century was partly real and partly a measurement artifact — women had always worked, but the nature and visibility of their work changed.

## The Quiet Revolution: Expectations, Education, and the Pill

Goldin identified a critical turning point in the 1970s — what she called the **quiet revolution**. Before this point, women's participation was rising, but women still planned their lives around marriage and children. Career was secondary. After this point, women began to form their **identities** around careers, not just jobs.

What changed? Three forces converged:

**The contraceptive pill**

Goldin (with Lawrence Katz) showed that access to the birth control pill was transformative. Using the fact that different U.S. states legalized the pill for young unmarried women at different times, she demonstrated that the pill:

- Allowed women to **delay marriage and childbirth** — giving them time to invest in education and establish careers
- Changed **career choices**: the proportion of women studying law, medicine, and business exploded. Between 1970 and 1980, women in law schools more than tripled; women in business schools increased tenfold
- Changed **expectations**: women who had access to the pill when young planned their entire lives differently — they expected careers, not just jobs

**Rising education**

Each generation of women was better educated than the last. But Goldin showed a crucial pattern: women's educational investments often **lagged behind** their opportunities. Women in the 1950s invested less in education than they should have, because they expected to follow their mothers' patterns (marry young, leave the workforce). By the time they realized the world had changed, it was too late to go back to school. Expectations matter — and outdated expectations are costly.

**Shifting social norms**

The women's rights movement, changing attitudes toward working mothers, and the visible success of pioneering women all contributed. But Goldin emphasized that norms changed **slowly** — much more slowly than economic conditions. The lag between opportunity and norm adjustment is a recurring theme in her work.

## The Motherhood Penalty: Where the Gap Really Opens

Here is Goldin's most striking finding: **the gender pay gap today is primarily a motherhood gap.**

At the start of their careers, men and women with the same education, in the same occupation, earn nearly the same. The gap is small and shrinking. But when the first child arrives, everything changes:

- Women's earnings **drop sharply** and recover slowly — if they recover at all
- Men's earnings are **unaffected** by fatherhood — they may even increase (the "fatherhood premium")
- In a 15-year study of University of Chicago MBA graduates, Goldin found that men and women started at similar salaries. Fifteen years later, women with children earned dramatically less — not because they were in different occupations, but because they had reduced hours, taken career breaks, or shifted to less demanding (and less lucrative) roles

The motherhood penalty is not about employer discrimination in the narrow sense. It's about how families respond to the arrival of children — and how the labor market rewards that response.

## Greedy Jobs: The Structural Root of the Gap

Goldin's deepest insight is the concept of **greedy jobs** — positions that disproportionately reward workers who are available at all hours, travel on short notice, never turn off their phones, and prioritize work above everything else.

- A corporate lawyer who bills 2,500 hours a year earns far more than twice what a lawyer billing 1,250 hours earns — the premium for total availability is enormous
- A management consultant who can fly to a client on Sunday night commands a premium over one who can't
- A finance executive who answers emails at midnight gets promoted faster than one who doesn't

These greedy jobs don't explicitly discriminate by gender. But when a couple has children, someone must be on call for the family — sick children, school pickups, bedtime routines. In most couples, it's the woman who adjusts. She takes the flexible job, the part-time role, the position with predictable hours. He takes the greedy job.

This isn't irrational — it's financially logical. If the greedy job pays a premium for total availability, the family maximizes income by having one spouse commit fully. Since the husband is often already earning slightly more (perhaps because he's slightly older or started full-time earlier), it makes sense for him to be the one who leans in. But this individually rational choice, repeated across millions of couples, produces the gender pay gap.

**The implication is profound**: the pay gap would shrink dramatically if greedy jobs didn't exist — if companies rewarded output rather than face time, if workers could share roles and work flexibly without penalty, if being a devoted parent didn't require sacrificing career advancement.

## Why It Took 200 Years of Data

Goldin's methodological innovation was insisting that you can't understand the present without understanding the past. Each generation's choices are shaped by the previous generation's experiences and expectations:

- Women in the 1950s planned their lives based on their mothers' experiences in the 1930s — and were caught off guard when the world changed
- Women in the 1970s had access to the pill and new career opportunities — but their expectations had been formed in a world without these tools
- Women today have equal education and legal rights — but work in labor markets whose structures were designed around male breadwinners with stay-at-home wives

Only by tracing the full arc — from farm to factory to office to Zoom call — could Goldin identify which forces were transient and which were structural, which barriers had fallen and which persisted in new forms.

Her 2023 Nobel Prize was awarded "for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes." She was the first woman to win the economics Nobel solo, and only the third woman ever to receive it (after Elinor Ostrom in 2009 and Esther Duflo in 2019).

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine two kids start the same race at the same time, running at the same speed. For the first part of the race, they're neck and neck. Then one kid has to stop and tie their little brother's shoes, help him get a drink, and carry him for a while. When they start running again, they're way behind — not because they're slower, but because they had to take care of someone. That's what happens to many women's careers when they have children. Goldin spent her whole career studying this by looking at records going back 200 years. She found that the pay difference between men and women isn't mostly about bosses paying women less for the same work — it's about the fact that certain jobs pay a LOT extra for being available 24/7, and when a family has kids, it's usually the mom who steps back from those demanding jobs to take care of the family. She also found that when the birth control pill was invented, it changed everything — women could plan when to have kids, so they could invest in long educations and start careers first. Her big idea for fixing the remaining gap? Change the jobs, not the women — make workplaces more flexible so that being a good parent doesn't mean giving up career success.

## 挥之不去的问题

现在女性获得大学学位的比例高于男性。她们以几乎相等的数量进入劳动力市场。她们是律师、医生、高管、工程师。然而在地球上每个国家，女性收入都低于男性——在美国，平均低约13%。

为什么？显而易见的答案——歧视——是故事的一部分，但远非全部。如果雇主只是对相同工作付给女性更少，竞争会消除差距：雇用被低估女性的公司会超越不这样做的公司。一定有更深层、更结构性的东西在起作用。

戈尔丁用她的职业生涯组装了答案。通过挖掘200年的美国数据——人口普查记录、税务档案、调查、机构档案——她追溯了女性经济参与的完整历史，并识别了在每个阶段塑造、缩小、扩大和顽固维持性别差距的力量。她的故事不是大多数人预期的那样。

---

## U型曲线：档案中的意外发现

传统叙事说女性工作是一个稳步前进的故事——从家庭主妇到工人，从被排斥到被接纳，一路向上攀升。

戈尔丁发现了相反的情况。过去200年女性劳动力参与率呈**U型曲线**：

- **农业时代（19世纪初）**：女性广泛工作——在农场、家庭企业、家庭手工业。她们的劳动在经济上至关重要，即使并不总是被记录
- **工业化（19世纪中期至20世纪初）**：随着生产从家庭转移到工厂，女性劳动力参与率**下降**了。工厂工作体力要求高，对已婚妇女有社会污名，且越来越与家庭分离。随着男性工资上升，家庭"负担得起"让妻子留在家中。社会规范硬化：工作的妻子暗示她丈夫养不起家
- **服务经济（20世纪初至今）**：随着经济转向文书、行政和专业工作，女性参与率开始**再次上升**。办公室工作更干净、更安全，更符合社会期望。教育扩大。曲线向上转弯

这个U型在戈尔丁挖掘档案之前是看不见的。此前的研究者大幅**低估了十九世纪女性的工作**，因为人口普查员不记录无偿农业劳动、家庭企业工作或在家完成的计件工作。戈尔丁证明1890年代末的女性就业率几乎是人口普查数据显示的**三倍**。二十世纪女性工作的"崛起"部分是真实的，部分是衡量假象——女性一直在工作，但她们工作的性质和可见度发生了变化。

## 安静的革命：期望、教育和避孕药

戈尔丁确定了1970年代的一个关键转折点——她称之为**安静的革命**。在此之前，女性参与率在上升，但女性仍然围绕婚姻和孩子规划生活。事业是次要的。在此之后，女性开始围绕**职业**而非仅仅工作来形成她们的**身份认同**。

什么改变了？三种力量汇合：

**避孕药**

戈尔丁（与卡茨合作）证明获得口服避孕药是变革性的。利用美国不同州在不同时间向年轻未婚女性合法化避孕药的事实，她证明避孕药：

- 允许女性**推迟结婚和生育**——给她们时间投资教育和建立事业
- 改变了**职业选择**：学习法律、医学和商科的女性比例爆发式增长。1970年至1980年间，法学院的女性增加了两倍多；商学院的女性增加了十倍
- 改变了**期望**：年轻时能获得避孕药的女性完全不同地规划她们的整个人生——她们期待事业，而不仅仅是工作

**教育提升**

每一代女性都比上一代受教育更多。但戈尔丁展示了一个关键模式：女性的教育投资常常**落后于**她们的机会。1950年代的女性在教育上的投资低于应有的水平，因为她们期望遵循母亲的模式（早婚、离开职场）。等她们意识到世界已经改变时，再回去上学已经太晚了。期望很重要——过时的期望代价高昂。

**社会规范转变**

女权运动、对职业母亲态度的改变以及先驱女性的显著成功都有贡献。但戈尔丁强调规范变化**缓慢**——比经济条件变化慢得多。机会与规范调整之间的滞后是她工作中反复出现的主题。

## 母职惩罚：差距真正打开的地方

这是戈尔丁最引人注目的发现：**今天的性别薪酬差距主要是母职差距。**

在职业生涯之初，相同教育、相同职业的男女收入几乎相同。差距很小且在缩小。但当第一个孩子到来时，一切都变了：

- 女性收入**急剧下降**，恢复缓慢——如果能恢复的话
- 男性收入不受父亲身份的**影响**——甚至可能增加（"父亲溢价"）
- 在对芝加哥大学MBA毕业生的15年跟踪研究中，戈尔丁发现男女起始薪资相似。十五年后，有孩子的女性收入大幅降低——不是因为她们在不同的职业中，而是因为她们减少了工时、职业中断、或转向要求较低（也较不赚钱）的角色

母职惩罚在狭义上不是关于雇主歧视。它是关于家庭如何回应孩子的到来——以及劳动力市场如何奖励这种回应。

## 贪婪的工作：差距的结构性根源

戈尔丁最深刻的洞见是**贪婪工作**的概念——那些不成比例地奖励全天候待命、随时出差、永不关机、将工作置于一切之上的工人的职位。

- 一个每年计费2500小时的公司律师远不止挣计费1250小时的律师的两倍——全身心投入的溢价是巨大的
- 一个能在周日晚上飞去见客户的管理顾问比不能的同行获得更高溢价
- 一个半夜回邮件的金融高管比不回的人升职更快

这些贪婪的工作没有明确按性别歧视。但当一对夫妇有了孩子，必须有人随时待命照顾家庭——生病的孩子、接放学、睡前例行程序。在大多数夫妇中，是女性做出调整。她选择灵活的工作、兼职角色、可预测时间的职位。他选择贪婪的工作。

这不是非理性的——这是财务上合理的。如果贪婪的工作为全身心投入支付溢价，家庭通过让一方全力投入来最大化收入。由于丈夫通常已经挣得略多（也许因为年龄略大或更早开始全职），让他全力投入是合理的。但这个个体理性的选择，在数百万对夫妇中重复，产生了性别薪酬差距。

**含义深远**：如果贪婪的工作不存在，薪酬差距将大幅缩小——如果公司奖励产出而非出勤时间，如果工人能分担角色和灵活工作而不受惩罚，如果成为一个尽职的父母不需要牺牲职业发展。

## 为什么需要200年的数据

戈尔丁的方法论创新在于坚持：不理解过去就无法理解现在。每一代人的选择都受到上一代经验和期望的塑造：

- 1950年代的女性基于母亲1930年代的经验规划生活——在世界改变时措手不及
- 1970年代的女性有了避孕药和新的职业机会——但她们的期望是在没有这些工具的世界中形成的
- 今天的女性有平等的教育和法律权利——但在围绕男性养家者和全职主妇设计的劳动力市场结构中工作

只有追溯完整的弧线——从农场到工厂到办公室到视频会议——戈尔丁才能识别哪些力量是暂时的、哪些是结构性的，哪些障碍已经倒下、哪些以新形式持续存在。

她2023年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其增进了我们对女性劳动力市场结果的理解。" 她是第一位独自赢得经济学诺贝尔奖的女性，也是第三位获得该奖的女性（继2009年的奥斯特罗姆和2019年的迪弗洛之后）。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象两个孩子同时起跑，速度一样。比赛前半段，他们并驾齐驱。然后一个孩子不得不停下来帮小弟弟系鞋带、帮他喝水、抱着他走一段。当她重新开始跑时，已经远远落后了——不是因为她跑得慢，而是因为她必须照顾别人。这就是许多女性有了孩子后职业生涯的遭遇。戈尔丁用她的整个职业生涯研究这个问题，查看了200年前的记录。她发现男女之间的薪酬差异主要不是因为老板对同样的工作付给女性更少——而是因为某些工作为24小时随叫随到支付很高的额外报酬，当一个家庭有了孩子时，通常是妈妈从那些高要求的工作退一步来照顾家庭。她还发现当避孕药被发明时，一切都改变了——女性可以计划何时生孩子，所以她们可以先投资长期教育和开始事业。她缩小剩余差距的大想法？改变工作，而不是改变女性——让工作场所更灵活，这样做一个好父母不意味着放弃事业成功。
