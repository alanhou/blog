## The Puzzle of Sustained Growth

For most of human history, economic growth barely existed. Living standards in 1700 were not dramatically different from those in ancient Rome. Inventions happened — the watermill, the printing press, gunpowder — but they never produced sustained, accelerating improvement in how people lived. Each burst of innovation eventually fizzled out.

Then something changed. Starting around 1750, economic growth took off — and it never stopped. In the past 275 years, income per capita in the leading economies has increased more than thirtyfold. Life expectancy doubled. Poverty plummeted. This extraordinary transformation is the single most important fact in economic history.

But **why didn't it stop?** Every previous innovation wave had petered out. What made the Industrial Revolution different? And what keeps the growth engine running today?

The 2025 Nobel Prize honored three economists who answered these questions from complementary angles. Joel Mokyr explained the historical prerequisites — why sustained growth finally became possible. Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt built the mathematical engine — a formal model of how creative destruction produces growth that feeds on itself.

## Mokyr: Why This Time Was Different

Joel Mokyr is an economic historian who asked the deepest question about growth: **why did innovation become self-sustaining in Europe after 1750, when it had always fizzled out before?**

Previous civilizations had impressive innovations. China invented paper, printing, gunpowder, and the compass. The Islamic world made breakthroughs in mathematics, optics, and medicine. Ancient Rome had engineering marvels. But none of these led to sustained growth. Innovation was sporadic, haphazard, and eventually ran out of steam.

**Mokyr's answer: the Enlightenment changed the relationship between knowledge and practice.**

**Before the Enlightenment**:
- Innovation was based on **trial and error** — tinkerers and craftsmen discovered things that worked, but they didn't understand *why* they worked
- Knowledge was **tacit** — embedded in individual skills, guild secrets, and craft traditions. It was hard to transmit, hard to improve systematically, and easy to lose
- There was no feedback loop between understanding nature and improving technology. A blacksmith might discover a better way to forge steel, but without understanding the chemistry of carbon and iron, the improvement couldn't be generalized or built upon
- Innovation depended on luck and individual genius. When the genius died or the guild declined, the knowledge could vanish

**After the Enlightenment**:
- A new intellectual culture emerged that valued **understanding** — not just knowing that something works, but knowing **why** it works
- This created what Mokyr calls **"useful knowledge"** — a growing body of systematic, communicable understanding of natural phenomena
- Crucially, a dialogue emerged between **propositional knowledge** (science — understanding nature) and **prescriptive knowledge** (technology — knowing how to make things). Science informed technology; technology posed questions for science. Each advance in one domain accelerated advances in the other
- Knowledge became **cumulative**: because it was systematic and communicable, each generation could build on the last. Innovation could compound rather than stagnate
- An **"industrial enlightenment"** — a culture of open inquiry, scientific societies, public lectures, and published findings — created institutions that sustained the feedback loop

**Why Europe?** Mokyr argues it wasn't inevitable. Europe's fragmented political structure meant that intellectual freedom could survive — if one kingdom suppressed new ideas, thinkers could move to another. Competition among states created incentives to adopt useful innovations. The Republic of Letters — a pan-European network of intellectuals — spread ideas faster than any single state could suppress them.

**The key insight**: The Industrial Revolution didn't sustain itself through any single technology. It sustained itself because the *process* of innovation had changed. Knowledge was now organized, cumulative, and self-reinforcing. This is why growth after 1750 didn't peter out — and why the pace of innovation accelerated rather than slowed.

## Aghion and Howitt: The Mathematics of Creative Destruction

While Mokyr explained *why* sustained growth became possible, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt explained *how* it works — and built a formal mathematical model that captured the engine of growth with precision.

Their starting point was an old idea from Joseph Schumpeter: capitalism grows through **creative destruction**. New products, new firms, and new technologies constantly displace old ones. The automobile destroyed the horse-and-buggy industry. The smartphone destroyed the camera, the GPS device, the MP3 player, and the alarm clock — all at once. Netflix destroyed Blockbuster. Each innovation creates value by destroying what came before.

Before Aghion and Howitt, growth theory (including Romer's endogenous growth model from 1990) treated innovation as **additive** — new products are added to existing ones, and the economy gets richer because there are more varieties. But this misses something fundamental: **growth often comes from replacement, not addition.** The new doesn't just join the old — it kills it.

**The Aghion-Howitt model (1992)**:

- Firms invest in R&D because successful innovation brings **temporary monopoly profits** — you're the only one with the new technology, so you can charge premium prices
- But your monopoly is temporary. Eventually, a competitor innovates and displaces you — exactly as you displaced the previous leader. This is creative destruction
- The **growth rate** depends on how much the economy invests in R&D, which depends on the expected profits from innovation, which depend on the size of the quality improvement and how long the monopoly lasts
- Growth follows a **quality ladder**: each innovation improves upon the previous generation of products, climbing one rung at a time. The economy grows not because there are more products, but because products get better

**Key results**:

- **Growth is endogenous**: The rate of technological progress is not an external force — it results from deliberate investment decisions by firms and entrepreneurs
- **Competition has an inverted-U effect on innovation**: Too little competition means monopolists have no incentive to innovate (they're already dominant). Too much competition means profits are too thin to fund R&D. Innovation is highest at intermediate levels of competition — a finding confirmed by extensive empirical research
- **Incumbents resist innovation**: Established firms have an incentive to block new technologies that would destroy their market position. Growth requires institutions that prevent incumbents from stifling competition — antitrust law, patent limits, open entry
- **Creative destruction creates losers**: Workers in displaced industries lose their jobs. Firms with obsolete technology go bankrupt. This creates political pressure to block innovation — tariffs, regulations, lobbying by incumbent industries. If this pressure succeeds, growth slows or stops
- **Social vs. private returns diverge**: Innovators capture only part of the value they create (the rest spills over to consumers and future innovators). But innovators also destroy value held by incumbents — a cost they don't bear. The net effect can go either way: society might underinvest or overinvest in R&D, depending on the balance

## The Complete Picture: History Meets Theory

Mokyr and Aghion-Howitt address the same phenomenon from different angles:

- **Mokyr** explains the historical conditions that made sustained innovation possible: the Enlightenment, the dialogue between science and technology, institutions that protected intellectual freedom, and a culture of open inquiry
- **Aghion and Howitt** formalize the mechanism: firms invest in R&D seeking monopoly profits, successful innovation displaces incumbents, the threat of being displaced motivates further innovation, and growth continues as long as the process isn't blocked

Together they deliver a powerful message: **sustained economic growth is not automatic.** It requires specific institutional conditions — open competition, protection of new entrants, investment in science, and tolerance for the disruption that creative destruction inevitably brings. Block any of these, and growth stalls.

As Nobel Committee Chair John Hassler stated: "The laureates' work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underlie creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation."

Their 2025 Nobel Prize was awarded to Mokyr "for having identified the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress" and jointly to Aghion and Howitt "for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine a race where everyone is running, but the track keeps being rebuilt by the runners themselves. Each runner invents a faster pair of shoes. But here's the twist: every time someone invents faster shoes, the old shoes become worthless. The runner who wore them falls behind unless they invent something even better. That's "creative destruction" — Aghion and Howitt showed that this endless race of replacing old things with better things is what makes economies grow. But why does this race keep going instead of everyone getting tired and stopping? Mokyr looked at history and found the answer: a long time ago, people started writing down not just *what* works but *why* it works. Once you understand why, you can keep improving — each discovery leads to the next. Before that, inventions were like lucky guesses that couldn't be repeated. After that, invention became a system that feeds itself. Together, their message is: growth keeps going only if we keep the race fair (don't let the big companies block new inventions) and keep investing in understanding *why* things work (that means science and education).

## 持续增长之谜

在人类历史的大部分时间里，经济增长几乎不存在。1700年的生活水平与古罗马没有太大不同。发明确实发生了——水磨、印刷术、火药——但它们从未产生持续的、加速的生活改善。每一波创新最终都熄灭了。

然后某些东西改变了。大约从1750年开始，经济增长起飞——而且再也没有停止。在过去275年里，领先经济体的人均收入增加了三十多倍。预期寿命翻倍。贫困骤降。这一非凡转变是经济史上最重要的事实。

但**为什么它没有停止？** 此前每一波创新都衰退了。是什么使工业革命与众不同？是什么让增长引擎今天继续运转？

2025年诺贝尔奖表彰了从互补角度回答这些问题的三位经济学家。莫基尔解释了历史前提——为什么持续增长终于成为可能。阿吉翁和霍伊特建造了数学引擎——一个关于创造性破坏如何产生自我驱动增长的正式模型。

---

## 莫基尔：为什么这一次不同

莫基尔是一位经济史学家，他提出了关于增长最深刻的问题：**为什么创新在1750年后的欧洲变得自我持续，而此前总是衰退？**

以前的文明有令人印象深刻的创新。中国发明了纸张、印刷术、火药和指南针。伊斯兰世界在数学、光学和医学方面取得了突破。古罗马有工程奇迹。但这些都没有导致持续增长。创新是偶发的、随意的，最终后劲不足。

**莫基尔的答案：启蒙运动改变了知识与实践之间的关系。**

**启蒙运动之前**：
- 创新基于**试错**——工匠和手艺人发现有效的东西，但他们不理解*为什么*有效
- 知识是**隐性的**——嵌入个人技能、行会秘密和工艺传统中。难以传播、难以系统改进、容易失传
- 理解自然和改进技术之间没有反馈循环。铁匠可能发现更好的炼钢方法，但不理解碳和铁的化学反应，改进就无法推广或在其基础上发展
- 创新依赖运气和个人天才。当天才去世或行会衰落时，知识可能消失

**启蒙运动之后**：
- 一种新的智识文化出现，重视**理解**——不仅知道某物有效，还知道**为什么**有效
- 这创造了莫基尔所称的**"有用知识"**——对自然现象的系统化、可传播理解的不断增长的知识体系
- 关键是，**命题性知识**（科学——理解自然）和**指令性知识**（技术——知道如何制造）之间出现了对话。科学为技术提供信息；技术为科学提出问题。一个领域的每次进步加速了另一个领域的进步
- 知识变得**累积性的**：因为它是系统化和可传播的，每一代人都可以在前一代的基础上建设。创新可以复合而非停滞
- **"工业启蒙"**——开放探究、科学学会、公开讲座和发表成果的文化——创造了维持反馈循环的制度

**为什么是欧洲？** 莫基尔认为这不是必然的。欧洲分散的政治结构意味着智识自由可以生存——如果一个王国压制新思想，思想家可以搬到另一个。国家间的竞争创造了采用有用创新的激励。"文人共和国"——一个泛欧洲的知识分子网络——传播思想的速度快于任何单一国家压制的速度。

**核心洞见**：工业革命不是通过任何单一技术自我维持的。它自我维持是因为创新的*过程*已经改变。知识现在是有组织的、累积的和自我强化的。这就是为什么1750年后的增长没有衰退——也是为什么创新的速度加速而非减慢。

## 阿吉翁和霍伊特：创造性破坏的数学

莫基尔解释了持续增长为什么*成为可能*，阿吉翁和霍伊特则解释了它*如何运作*——并建造了一个精确捕捉增长引擎的正式数学模型。

他们的出发点是约瑟夫·熊彼特的一个旧观念：资本主义通过**创造性破坏**增长。新产品、新企业和新技术不断取代旧的。汽车摧毁了马车行业。智能手机同时摧毁了相机、GPS设备、MP3播放器和闹钟。Netflix摧毁了百视达。每项创新通过摧毁之前的东西来创造价值。

在阿吉翁和霍伊特之前，增长理论（包括罗默1990年的内生增长模型）将创新视为**累加的**——新产品被添加到现有产品中，经济因为有更多种类而变得更富裕。但这遗漏了根本性的东西：**增长往往来自替代，而非添加。** 新的不只是加入旧的——它杀死旧的。

**阿吉翁-霍伊特模型（1992年）**：

- 企业投资研发因为成功的创新带来**暂时的垄断利润**——你是唯一拥有新技术的，所以可以收取溢价
- 但你的垄断是暂时的。最终，竞争者创新并取代你——正如你取代了前一个领导者。这就是创造性破坏
- **增长率**取决于经济在研发上投资多少，这取决于创新的预期利润，这又取决于质量改进的幅度和垄断持续的时间
- 增长遵循**质量阶梯**：每项创新在前一代产品的基础上改进，一次爬一个台阶。经济增长不是因为产品更多，而是因为产品变得更好

**关键结果**：

- **增长是内生的**：技术进步的速度不是外部力量——它源于企业和企业家的刻意投资决策
- **竞争对创新有倒U型效应**：太少的竞争意味着垄断者没有创新激励（他们已经占主导地位）。太多的竞争意味着利润太薄无法资助研发。创新在中等竞争水平最高——这一发现被广泛的实证研究证实
- **在位者抵制创新**：现有企业有激励阻止会摧毁其市场地位的新技术。增长需要防止在位者扼杀竞争的制度——反垄断法、专利限制、开放进入
- **创造性破坏产生输家**：被取代行业的工人失去工作。拥有过时技术的企业破产。这创造了阻止创新的政治压力——关税、法规、在位行业的游说。如果这种压力成功，增长就会放缓或停止
- **社会回报与私人回报分离**：创新者只获取他们创造的部分价值（其余溢出到消费者和未来创新者）。但创新者也摧毁了在位者持有的价值——这是他们不承担的成本。净效应可能两个方向都有：社会可能在研发上投资不足或过度投资，取决于平衡

## 完整图景：历史遇见理论

莫基尔和阿吉翁-霍伊特从不同角度处理同一现象：

- **莫基尔**解释了使持续创新成为可能的历史条件：启蒙运动、科学与技术之间的对话、保护智识自由的制度，以及开放探究的文化
- **阿吉翁和霍伊特**形式化了机制：企业投资研发寻求垄断利润、成功创新取代在位者、被取代的威胁激励进一步创新，只要过程不被阻断增长就继续

他们共同传递了一个强有力的信息：**持续的经济增长不是自动的。** 它需要特定的制度条件——开放竞争、保护新进入者、投资科学，以及对创造性破坏不可避免带来的颠覆的容忍。阻止其中任何一个，增长就会停滞。

正如诺贝尔委员会主席哈斯勒所说："获奖者的工作表明经济增长不能被视为理所当然。我们必须维护创造性破坏背后的机制，这样我们才不会退回到停滞。"

他们2025年的诺贝尔奖授予莫基尔"因其识别了通过技术进步实现持续增长的前提条件"，共同授予阿吉翁和霍伊特"因其创造性破坏实现持续增长的理论"。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象一场比赛，每个人都在跑，但跑道不断被跑步者自己重建。每个跑步者发明一双更快的鞋。但有个转折：每当有人发明更快的鞋，旧鞋就变得一文不值。穿旧鞋的跑步者落后了，除非他们发明更好的东西。这就是"创造性破坏"——阿吉翁和霍伊特证明了这种不断用更好的东西替换旧东西的无尽赛跑就是经济增长的动力。但为什么这场赛跑持续进行而不是所有人都累了停下来？莫基尔研究了历史并找到了答案：很久以前，人们开始记录的不仅仅是*什么*有效，还有*为什么*有效。一旦你理解了为什么，你就能不断改进——每个发现导向下一个。在那之前，发明就像无法重复的幸运猜测。在那之后，发明变成了一个自我驱动的系统。他们的信息合在一起是：增长只有在我们保持比赛公平（不让大公司阻止新发明）并持续投资于理解*为什么*事物有效（这意味着科学和教育）的情况下才能持续。
