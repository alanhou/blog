## The Information Problem at the Heart of Policy

Governments want to tax the rich more than the poor. But they can't directly observe ability — only income. And income depends on choices: a talented person might work less if taxes are too high. Insurance companies want to charge risky drivers more. But they can't observe riskiness — only claims history. Auctioneers want to sell to whoever values the item most. But they can't read minds — only bids.

All these problems share a common structure: **someone must design a system (tax code, insurance contract, auction) that works well even though the participants have private information they may not want to reveal.** James Mirrlees and William Vickrey independently developed the theoretical tools to solve such problems — laying the foundations for what would become mechanism design theory.

## Vickrey: The Auction That Makes You Tell the Truth

In 1961, William Vickrey asked a question that seems impossible: can you design an auction where every bidder's best strategy is to bid exactly what the item is worth to them — no bluffing, no strategic underbidding?

The answer was the **Vickrey auction** (second-price sealed-bid auction):

- Each bidder submits a sealed bid
- The highest bidder wins
- But they pay the second-highest bid, not their own

Why does this work? If you bid less than your true value, you might lose to someone who values it less — a missed opportunity. If you bid more than your true value, you might win but pay more than it's worth to you — a loss. Bidding your true value is always the safest strategy. **Truth-telling is the dominant strategy.**

This was far more than an auction trick. Vickrey established fundamental principles:

- **Incentive compatibility**: A well-designed mechanism can align individual incentives with social goals — making honesty the best policy
- **Revenue equivalence**: Under standard assumptions, all common auction formats (English, Dutch, sealed-bid first-price, sealed-bid second-price) generate the same expected revenue for the seller
- **The revelation principle**: Any outcome achievable by any mechanism can also be achieved by a direct mechanism where participants truthfully report their private information

These principles became the foundation of auction theory and mechanism design — with applications from spectrum auctions (worth billions) to online advertising (Google's ad auction is essentially a Vickrey mechanism).

## Vickrey's Other Innovations

Vickrey was remarkably versatile. Beyond auction theory, he pioneered:

- **Congestion pricing**: Vickrey proposed in the 1950s that road tolls and transit fares should vary by time of day — higher during rush hour, lower off-peak — to reduce congestion. This idea, radical at the time, is now implemented in cities worldwide
- **Marginal cost pricing for public utilities**: Electricity, water, and transit should be priced at marginal cost, with peak-load pricing to manage demand
- **Cumulative averaging for income tax**: To smooth the tax burden over a lifetime rather than penalizing volatile incomes

## Mirrlees: The Optimal Income Tax

James Mirrlees tackled what may be the most important question in public economics: **how should a government design its income tax if it wants to redistribute income but can't observe people's abilities?**

The dilemma: the government wants to tax high-ability people more. But it can only observe income, not ability. If it taxes high incomes heavily, high-ability people may choose to work less — reducing both their income and the tax revenue available for redistribution. The tax system must balance:

- **Equity**: Transferring resources from rich to poor
- **Efficiency**: Not discouraging productive work
- **Incentive compatibility**: Ensuring high-ability people don't pretend to be low-ability by working less

Mirrlees's 1971 paper solved this problem mathematically, deriving the **optimal nonlinear income tax schedule** — the tax structure that maximizes social welfare subject to incentive constraints.

Key results:

- **The optimal marginal tax rate is not simply progressive**: It doesn't just rise with income. Under standard assumptions, the optimal marginal rate at the very top is zero — a counterintuitive result because taxing the highest earner's last dollar more doesn't change their ranking, only discourages their effort
- **The tradeoff is quantifiable**: Mirrlees showed exactly how much redistribution you sacrifice for each unit of efficiency, and vice versa — making the equity-efficiency tradeoff precise rather than vague
- **Information constraints bind**: The optimal tax is less redistributive than a first-best (full information) tax would be — because the government must respect the fact that it can't observe ability directly

## The Broader Legacy: Mechanism Design

Together, Mirrlees and Vickrey established the intellectual framework for **mechanism design** — the science of designing institutions and rules that achieve desired outcomes when participants have private information:

- **Principal-agent theory**: How should an employer design a contract when they can't observe the worker's effort? (Moral hazard)
- **Screening and signaling**: How can an uninformed party (insurer, employer) design a menu of options that induces informed parties (drivers, workers) to reveal their type?
- **Public goods provision**: How can a government determine the true demand for public goods when citizens have incentives to understate their willingness to pay?

Their 1996 Nobel Prize was awarded "for their fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information."

Tragically, William Vickrey died just three days after the Nobel announcement, at age 82.

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you're selling your old toys at a yard sale, but you don't know how much each buyer would really pay. In a normal auction, buyers try to pay as little as possible — they hide what they truly think. Vickrey invented a clever rule: the winner pays what the second-highest person bid, not what they bid themselves. This magic trick makes everyone bid honestly, because there's no advantage to lying. Now imagine you're a teacher who wants to give harder homework to smarter students — but you can't read minds to know who's smart. If you make the hard homework too painful, smart kids will pretend to be average. Mirrlees figured out the best way to assign homework (or taxes) so that everyone reveals who they really are — without making the system so harsh that people give up.

## 政策核心的信息问题

政府想对富人多征税。但它无法直接观察能力——只能观察收入。而收入取决于选择：有才能的人如果税率太高可能选择少工作。保险公司想对高风险司机多收费。但它无法观察风险程度——只能看理赔记录。拍卖师想把东西卖给最看重它的人。但他们不能读心——只能看出价。

所有这些问题共享一个共同结构：**必须设计一个系统（税法、保险合同、拍卖），即使参与者拥有他们可能不想透露的私人信息，系统也能良好运作。** 莫里斯和维克里独立开发了解决此类问题的理论工具——为后来的机制设计理论奠定了基础。

## 维克里：让你说真话的拍卖

1961年，维克里提出了一个看似不可能的问题：能否设计一种拍卖，使每个竞标者的最佳策略就是出价恰好等于物品对他们的真实价值——不虚张声势，不策略性压价？

答案就是**维克里拍卖**（第二价格密封投标拍卖）：

- 每个竞标者提交密封出价
- 最高出价者获胜
- 但他们支付的是第二高的出价，而非自己的出价

为什么这行得通？如果你出价低于真实价值，你可能输给一个估值更低的人——错失机会。如果你出价高于真实价值，你可能赢了但支付超过它对你的价值——亏损。出真实价值永远是最安全的策略。**说真话是占优策略。**

这远不止是一个拍卖技巧。维克里确立了根本性原则：

- **激励相容**：设计良好的机制可以使个人激励与社会目标一致——让诚实成为最佳策略
- **收入等价**：在标准假设下，所有常见拍卖形式（英式、荷式、第一价格密封、第二价格密封）为卖方产生相同的预期收入
- **显示原理**：任何机制可实现的结果，也可以通过参与者如实报告私人信息的直接机制来实现

这些原则成为拍卖理论和机制设计的基础——应用从频谱拍卖（价值数十亿）到在线广告（谷歌的广告拍卖本质上就是维克里机制）。

## 维克里的其他创新

维克里的才华极为多面。除了拍卖理论，他还开创了：

- **拥堵定价**：维克里在1950年代提出道路收费和公交票价应按时段变化——高峰时段更高，非高峰更低——以减少拥堵。这个在当时激进的想法现已在全球城市实施
- **公用事业的边际成本定价**：电力、水和公交应按边际成本定价，用高峰负荷定价管理需求
- **所得税的累积平均**：在一生中平滑税负，而非惩罚收入波动大的人

## 莫里斯：最优所得税

莫里斯解决了公共经济学中也许最重要的问题：**如果政府想再分配收入但无法观察人们的能力，应如何设计所得税？**

困境：政府想对高能力者多征税。但它只能观察收入，不能观察能力。如果对高收入征重税，高能力者可能选择少工作——既减少了他们的收入，也减少了可用于再分配的税收。税制必须平衡：

- **公平**：将资源从富人转移到穷人
- **效率**：不打击生产性劳动
- **激励相容**：确保高能力者不会通过少工作来假装低能力

莫里斯1971年的论文用数学解决了这个问题，推导出**最优非线性所得税表**——在激励约束下最大化社会福利的税制结构。

关键结果：

- **最优边际税率不是简单累进的**：它不只是随收入上升。在标准假设下，最顶端的最优边际税率为零——这个反直觉的结果是因为对最高收入者的最后一元多征税不会改变他们的排名，只会打击他们的努力
- **权衡是可量化的**：莫里斯精确展示了每单位效率你牺牲多少再分配，反之亦然——使公平-效率权衡精确而非模糊
- **信息约束是有约束力的**：最优税比第一最优（完全信息）税的再分配程度更低——因为政府必须尊重它无法直接观察能力的事实

## 更广泛的遗产：机制设计

莫里斯和维克里共同建立了**机制设计**的智识框架——在参与者拥有私人信息时设计实现预期结果的制度和规则的科学：

- **委托-代理理论**：当雇主无法观察工人的努力时，应如何设计合同？（道德风险）
- **筛选与信号传递**：不知情的一方（保险公司、雇主）如何设计一组选项，诱导知情方（司机、工人）揭示其类型？
- **公共品供给**：当公民有动机低报支付意愿时，政府如何确定公共品的真实需求？

他们1996年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对不对称信息下经济激励理论的根本性贡献。"

令人惋惜的是，维克里在诺贝尔奖宣布仅三天后去世，享年82岁。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你在院子里卖旧玩具，但你不知道每个买家真正愿意付多少钱。在普通拍卖中，买家尽量少付——他们隐藏真实想法。维克里发明了一个巧妙的规则：赢家支付的是第二高的出价，而不是自己的出价。这个魔术让每个人都诚实出价，因为说谎没有好处。现在想象你是一个老师，想给更聪明的学生布置更难的作业——但你不能读心术知道谁聪明。如果你把难作业弄得太痛苦，聪明的孩子会假装普通。莫里斯找到了分配作业（或税收）的最佳方式，让每个人都展示真实的自己——同时不让制度严苛到人们放弃努力。
