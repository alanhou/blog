## Abstract

This paper introduces a specialized technical curriculum designed to equip translation and specialized communication professionals with foundational AI literacy. The curriculum addresses a critical gap in the language and translation industry by providing accessible yet rigorous training in four core areas: vector embeddings, neural network fundamentals, tokenization mechanisms, and transformer architectures. Tested in a master's-level course at TH Koeln's Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication, the curriculum aims to develop computational thinking, algorithmic awareness, and algorithmic agency among practitioners. While initial results demonstrate didactic effectiveness, the study reveals that optimal learning outcomes require additional pedagogical scaffolding and instructor support to help learners navigate the technical complexity.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a domain-specific technical AI curriculum tailored for translation and communication professionals rather than computer science students
- Structured progression through four fundamental AI concepts: vector embeddings, neural networks, tokenization, and transformer architectures
- Empirical validation through implementation in an MA-level course, providing evidence of both effectiveness and areas for improvement
- Framework for building "algorithmic agency" and "digital resilience" in AI-driven professional environments
- Identification of the need for pedagogical scaffolding to bridge the gap between technical content and non-technical learners

## Curriculum Design and Pedagogical Approach

The curriculum is structured around four interconnected modules that build progressively on each other. The first module on vector embeddings introduces learners to how language is represented numerically in AI systems, covering concepts like word2vec, semantic similarity, and embedding spaces. This foundation is crucial because embeddings underpin virtually all modern NLP applications.

The neural network module provides technical depth into how these systems learn and process information. Rather than treating neural networks as black boxes, the curriculum exposes learners to backpropagation, activation functions, and gradient descent—enabling them to understand not just what these systems do, but how they work at an algorithmic level.

Tokenization, often overlooked in high-level AI education, receives dedicated attention as the critical interface between human language and machine processing. The curriculum explores different tokenization strategies (word-level, subword, character-level) and their implications for multilingual applications—particularly relevant for translation professionals.

The transformer architecture module synthesizes previous concepts, showing how attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and encoder-decoder structures combine to enable modern language models. This module connects technical understanding to practical applications in machine translation and language generation.

## Implementation and Evaluation Results

The curriculum was piloted in an AI-focused master's course at TH Koeln, providing real-world validation of its pedagogical approach. The implementation revealed several important insights about teaching technical AI concepts to non-computer science audiences.

Participants demonstrated measurable improvements in computational thinking and algorithmic awareness, suggesting the curriculum successfully bridges the gap between abstract AI concepts and practical understanding. Learners developed the ability to reason about AI systems algorithmically rather than treating them as opaque tools.

However, feedback highlighted significant challenges. Many participants struggled with the mathematical foundations required for deep understanding of neural networks and transformers. The self-directed nature of the curriculum, while promoting active learning, sometimes left learners without adequate support when encountering conceptual obstacles.

The study found that optimal learning outcomes required what the author terms "higher-level didactic scaffolding"—structured instructor support, guided problem-solving sessions, and opportunities for collaborative learning. This suggests that while the curriculum content is sound, its delivery mechanism needs enhancement for diverse learner populations.

## Implications for AI Education in Professional Contexts

This work addresses a broader challenge in AI education: how to provide technical depth without requiring extensive mathematical or programming prerequisites. The translation and communication industry represents a microcosm of this challenge—professionals need genuine understanding of AI systems they work with, but traditional computer science curricula are often inaccessible or irrelevant to their needs.

The concept of "algorithmic agency" introduced in this paper is particularly significant. Rather than simply training users to operate AI tools, the curriculum aims to develop critical understanding that enables professionals to make informed decisions about when and how to use AI, recognize its limitations, and advocate for appropriate implementations in their work contexts.

The emphasis on "digital resilience" acknowledges that AI-driven transformation of professional work is ongoing. By building foundational technical literacy, the curriculum prepares professionals not just for current AI tools but for continued adaptation as technologies evolve.

The findings also have implications beyond translation. Any professional field increasingly mediated by AI—from healthcare to law to creative industries—faces similar challenges in building appropriate technical literacy among practitioners. This curriculum provides a model for domain-specific AI education that balances technical rigor with accessibility.

## Takeaways

1. Technical AI literacy for non-technical professionals requires carefully designed curricula that balance depth with accessibility, focusing on conceptual foundations rather than implementation details.

2. Vector embeddings, neural networks, tokenization, and transformers form a coherent progression of concepts that build genuine understanding of modern language AI systems.

3. Algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency are distinct learning outcomes—understanding how systems work versus being able to make informed decisions about their use.

4. Self-directed technical learning, while valuable, requires substantial pedagogical scaffolding including instructor support and collaborative learning opportunities.

5. Domain-specific AI education (e.g., for translation professionals) is more effective than generic AI literacy programs because it connects technical concepts to familiar professional contexts.

6. Digital resilience in AI-driven work environments depends on foundational technical understanding, not just tool proficiency.

7. The gap between curriculum design and effective delivery is significant—content quality alone does not guarantee learning outcomes without appropriate pedagogical support structures.

## 摘要

本文提出了一套专门为翻译和专业传播从业者设计的技术课程,旨在培养其基础AI素养。该课程通过提供易于理解但严谨的培训,填补了语言翻译行业的关键空白,涵盖四个核心领域:向量嵌入、神经网络基础、分词机制和Transformer架构。课程在科隆应用技术大学翻译与多语言传播研究所的硕士课程中进行了测试,目标是培养从业者的计算思维、算法意识和算法能动性。虽然初步结果显示了教学有效性,但研究表明,为实现最佳学习效果,需要额外的教学支架和讲师支持来帮助学习者应对技术复杂性。

## 主要贡献

- 开发了针对翻译和传播专业人员而非计算机科学学生的领域特定技术AI课程
- 构建了四个基础AI概念的结构化进阶体系:向量嵌入、神经网络、分词和Transformer架构
- 通过硕士课程实施进行实证验证,提供了有效性证据并识别改进空间
- 提出了在AI驱动的专业环境中构建"算法能动性"和"数字韧性"的框架
- 识别了技术内容与非技术学习者之间需要教学支架来弥合差距的需求

## 课程设计与教学方法

课程围绕四个相互关联的模块构建,逐步递进。第一个模块关于向量嵌入,向学习者介绍语言如何在AI系统中进行数值表示,涵盖word2vec、语义相似度和嵌入空间等概念。这一基础至关重要,因为嵌入支撑着几乎所有现代NLP应用。

神经网络模块提供了这些系统如何学习和处理信息的技术深度。课程不是将神经网络视为黑盒,而是让学习者接触反向传播、激活函数和梯度下降等内容,使他们不仅理解这些系统做什么,还理解它们在算法层面如何工作。

分词在高层次AI教育中常被忽视,但在本课程中获得了专门关注,因为它是人类语言与机器处理之间的关键接口。课程探讨不同的分词策略(词级、子词、字符级)及其对多语言应用的影响,这对翻译专业人员尤其相关。

Transformer架构模块综合了之前的概念,展示注意力机制、位置编码和编码器-解码器结构如何结合以实现现代语言模型。该模块将技术理解与机器翻译和语言生成的实际应用联系起来。

## 实施与评估结果

该课程在科隆应用技术大学的AI硕士课程中进行了试点,为其教学方法提供了实际验证。实施过程揭示了向非计算机科学受众教授技术AI概念的几个重要见解。

参与者在计算思维和算法意识方面表现出可测量的提升,表明课程成功地在抽象AI概念与实际理解之间架起了桥梁。学习者发展出了从算法角度推理AI系统的能力,而不是将其视为不透明的工具。

然而,反馈也突显了重大挑战。许多参与者在深入理解神经网络和Transformer所需的数学基础方面遇到困难。课程的自主学习性质虽然促进了主动学习,但有时在学习者遇到概念障碍时缺乏足够支持。

研究发现,最佳学习效果需要作者所称的"高层次教学支架"——结构化的讲师支持、引导式问题解决会议和协作学习机会。这表明虽然课程内容扎实,但其交付机制需要针对不同学习者群体进行增强。

## 对专业情境中AI教育的启示

这项工作解决了AI教育中的一个更广泛挑战:如何在不需要大量数学或编程先决条件的情况下提供技术深度。翻译和传播行业代表了这一挑战的缩影——专业人员需要真正理解他们使用的AI系统,但传统的计算机科学课程往往难以接触或与其需求无关。

论文中引入的"算法能动性"概念尤其重要。课程的目标不仅是培训用户操作AI工具,而是发展批判性理解,使专业人员能够就何时以及如何使用AI做出明智决策,认识其局限性,并在工作环境中倡导适当的实施。

对"数字韧性"的强调承认,AI驱动的专业工作转型正在持续进行。通过建立基础技术素养,课程不仅为当前的AI工具做准备,还为技术演进过程中的持续适应做准备。

研究结果对翻译之外的领域也有启示。任何日益由AI中介的专业领域——从医疗保健到法律再到创意产业——都面临在从业者中建立适当技术素养的类似挑战。该课程为领域特定的AI教育提供了一个模型,在技术严谨性与可及性之间取得平衡。

## 要点总结

1. 面向非技术专业人员的技术AI素养需要精心设计的课程,在深度与可及性之间取得平衡,关注概念基础而非实现细节。

2. 向量嵌入、神经网络、分词和Transformer构成了一个连贯的概念进阶体系,能够建立对现代语言AI系统的真正理解。

3. 算法意识和算法能动性是不同的学习结果——理解系统如何工作与能够就其使用做出明智决策是两回事。

4. 自主技术学习虽然有价值,但需要大量教学支架,包括讲师支持和协作学习机会。

5. 领域特定的AI教育(如面向翻译专业人员)比通用AI素养项目更有效,因为它将技术概念与熟悉的专业情境联系起来。

6. AI驱动工作环境中的数字韧性依赖于基础技术理解,而不仅仅是工具熟练度。

7. 课程设计与有效交付之间的差距是显著的——没有适当的教学支持结构,仅凭内容质量无法保证学习成果。
