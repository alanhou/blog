## From Folklore to Science

Before the 1950s, investing was an art. Stock pickers relied on intuition, tips, and rules of thumb. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" was about as sophisticated as diversification theory got. No one had a rigorous framework for answering the most basic questions: How should you construct a portfolio? How should you price risk? Does it matter how a company finances itself?

Three economists answered these questions and, in doing so, created modern financial economics. Harry Markowitz showed how to build optimal portfolios. William Sharpe showed how markets price risk. Merton Miller (building on his earlier work with Modigliani) showed what matters — and what doesn't — in corporate finance. Together, they provided the intellectual foundation for everything from index funds to derivatives pricing.

## Markowitz: Portfolio Selection and the Efficient Frontier

In 1952, a 25-year-old graduate student named Harry Markowitz published a 14-page paper that would revolutionize investing. The key insight was deceptively simple: **don't evaluate investments in isolation — evaluate them as part of a portfolio.**

Before Markowitz, investors thought about risk and return one stock at a time. A "good" stock had high expected returns. But Markowitz showed that what matters isn't just each stock's individual risk — it's how stocks move together. Two risky stocks that move in opposite directions can create a portfolio that's less risky than either stock alone.

The **mean-variance framework**:

- **Return**: Measured by the expected (mean) return of the portfolio
- **Risk**: Measured by the variance (or standard deviation) of portfolio returns
- **Correlation is key**: The risk of a portfolio depends critically on the correlations between its assets. Low or negative correlations enable diversification — reducing risk without sacrificing return
- **The efficient frontier**: The set of portfolios that offer the maximum expected return for each level of risk. Any rational investor should choose a portfolio on this frontier — anything else is suboptimal

This was the first time anyone had formalized the tradeoff between risk and return mathematically. It transformed portfolio management from guesswork into optimization — and it's still the foundation of how institutional investors allocate assets today.

## Sharpe: The Capital Asset Pricing Model

Markowitz showed how an individual investor should construct a portfolio. William Sharpe asked the next question: **if everyone follows Markowitz's advice, what happens to market prices?**

The answer was the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** (1964), one of the most influential models in all of economics:

- **The market portfolio**: If all investors optimize using Markowitz's framework, they all hold the same risky portfolio — the market portfolio, containing every asset weighted by its market value. The only choice is how much to put in the market portfolio versus the risk-free asset
- **Beta**: The relevant measure of risk for any individual asset is not its total volatility, but its **beta** — its sensitivity to market movements. A stock with beta 1.5 moves 50% more than the market; a stock with beta 0.5 moves half as much
- **The security market line**: Expected return = risk-free rate + beta × market risk premium. Higher beta means higher expected return — and this is the only risk that's rewarded, because all other risk can be diversified away
- **Systematic vs. unsystematic risk**: The market rewards you for bearing systematic risk (market-wide risk that can't be diversified). It does not reward you for unsystematic risk (company-specific risk that can be eliminated through diversification)

The CAPM's practical implications were revolutionary:

- **Index funds**: If the market portfolio is optimal, why pay stock pickers? Just buy the whole market. This insight led directly to the creation of index funds — now holding trillions of dollars
- **The Sharpe ratio**: Sharpe developed the ratio of excess return to volatility as a measure of risk-adjusted performance — still the most widely used performance metric in finance
- **Cost of capital**: The CAPM provides a way to estimate the required return on any investment, based on its systematic risk — essential for corporate investment decisions

## Miller: Corporate Finance and the Irrelevance Propositions

Merton Miller's contribution (developed with Franco Modigliani, who won the 1985 Nobel) established the theoretical foundations of corporate finance through a series of "irrelevance" propositions:

- **Capital structure irrelevance**: In perfect markets, a firm's value doesn't depend on whether it's financed by debt or equity. The total value of the firm equals the present value of its cash flows — slicing those cash flows differently between debt and equity doesn't change the total
- **Dividend irrelevance**: Whether a firm pays dividends or retains earnings doesn't affect its value. Investors can create their own "dividends" by selling shares, or reinvest dividends by buying more
- **The tax shield**: In the real world, interest payments are tax-deductible, creating a tax advantage for debt. Miller showed how to quantify this advantage and how it interacts with personal taxes

Like the CAPM, the power of Miller's theorems lies in what they reveal about the real world by establishing what's true in an ideal one. Capital structure matters because of taxes, bankruptcy costs, and information asymmetries — and Miller's framework tells us exactly how and why.

His 1990 Nobel Prize was shared "for their pioneering work in the theory of financial economics."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you're picking players for a dodgeball team. You could pick the five strongest throwers — but if they're all slow, your team has a weakness. Instead, you pick some strong throwers, some fast dodgers, and some good catchers. The team is better than any individual player. That's Markowitz — pick investments that work well together, not just ones that look good alone. Now Sharpe asked: what if everyone picks the best team the same way? Then the "price" of each player depends on one thing — how much they help the whole team, not how good they are by themselves. And Miller said: it doesn't matter if your team wears red jerseys or blue jerseys — what matters is how well they play.

## 从经验法则到科学

1950年代之前，投资是一门艺术。选股者依赖直觉、小道消息和经验法则。"不要把所有鸡蛋放在一个篮子里"大概就是分散投资理论的最高水平了。没有人有一个严谨的框架来回答最基本的问题：你应该如何构建投资组合？如何为风险定价？企业的融资方式重要吗？

三位经济学家回答了这些问题，并由此创造了现代金融经济学。马科维茨展示了如何构建最优投资组合。夏普展示了市场如何为风险定价。米勒（在他与莫迪利安尼早期工作的基础上）展示了什么重要、什么不重要。他们共同为从指数基金到衍生品定价的一切提供了智识基础。

## 马科维茨：投资组合选择与有效前沿

1952年，一位25岁的研究生马科维茨发表了一篇14页的论文，彻底改变了投资方式。关键洞见看似简单：**不要孤立地评估投资——要将它们作为投资组合的一部分来评估。**

在马科维茨之前，投资者逐只股票地思考风险和回报。"好"股票就是预期回报高的股票。但马科维茨证明，重要的不仅是每只股票的个别风险——而是股票之间如何联动。两只朝相反方向波动的高风险股票可以组成一个比任何一只单独风险都低的投资组合。

**均值-方差框架**：

- **回报**：用投资组合的预期（均值）回报衡量
- **风险**：用投资组合回报的方差（或标准差）衡量
- **相关性是关键**：投资组合的风险关键取决于资产之间的相关性。低相关或负相关实现分散化——在不牺牲回报的情况下降低风险
- **有效前沿**：在每个风险水平上提供最大预期回报的投资组合集合。任何理性投资者都应选择这条前沿上的组合——其他任何选择都是次优的

这是第一次有人用数学形式化了风险与回报之间的权衡。它将投资组合管理从猜测变成了优化——至今仍是机构投资者配置资产的基础。

## 夏普：资本资产定价模型

马科维茨展示了个人投资者应如何构建投资组合。夏普问了下一个问题：**如果每个人都遵循马科维茨的建议，市场价格会怎样？**

答案就是**资本资产定价模型（CAPM）**（1964年），经济学中最有影响力的模型之一：

- **市场组合**：如果所有投资者都用马科维茨的框架优化，他们都持有同一个风险组合——市场组合，包含每种资产并按市值加权。唯一的选择是在市场组合和无风险资产之间分配多少
- **贝塔**：任何单个资产的相关风险度量不是其总波动率，而是其**贝塔值**——对市场波动的敏感度。贝塔为1.5的股票波动幅度比市场大50%；贝塔为0.5的股票波动幅度是市场的一半
- **证券市场线**：预期回报 = 无风险利率 + 贝塔 × 市场风险溢价。更高的贝塔意味着更高的预期回报——这是唯一被补偿的风险，因为所有其他风险都可以通过分散化消除
- **系统性风险与非系统性风险**：市场补偿你承担系统性风险（无法分散的全市场风险）。它不补偿非系统性风险（可以通过分散化消除的公司特定风险）

CAPM的实际影响是革命性的：

- **指数基金**：如果市场组合是最优的，为什么要付钱给选股者？直接买入整个市场。这一洞见直接导致了指数基金的创建——现在管理着数万亿美元
- **夏普比率**：夏普开发了超额回报与波动率之比作为风险调整后绩效的度量——至今仍是金融界使用最广泛的绩效指标
- **资本成本**：CAPM提供了一种基于系统性风险估计任何投资所需回报率的方法——对企业投资决策至关重要

## 米勒：公司金融与无关性命题

米勒的贡献（与莫迪利安尼合作发展，后者获得1985年诺贝尔奖）通过一系列"无关性"命题奠定了公司金融的理论基础：

- **资本结构无关性**：在完美市场中，企业价值不取决于它是用债务还是股权融资。企业总价值等于其现金流的现值——在债务和股权之间不同地切分这些现金流不会改变总量
- **股利无关性**：企业是否支付股利或留存收益不影响其价值。投资者可以通过卖出股票创造自己的"股利"，或通过买入更多股票再投资股利
- **税盾**：在现实世界中，利息支付可以抵税，为债务创造了税收优势。米勒展示了如何量化这一优势以及它如何与个人税收互动

与CAPM一样，米勒定理的力量在于通过确立理想世界中什么是成立的，来揭示现实世界中什么是重要的。资本结构之所以重要，是因为税收、破产成本和信息不对称——米勒的框架精确地告诉我们如何以及为什么。

他们1990年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其在金融经济学理论方面的开创性工作。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你在挑选躲避球队员。你可以挑五个最强壮的投手——但如果他们都跑得慢，你的队伍就有弱点。不如挑一些强壮的投手、一些跑得快的闪避者和一些好的接球手。这个队伍比任何单个球员都强。这就是马科维茨——挑选配合得好的投资，而不仅仅是单独看起来好的。然后夏普问：如果每个人都用同样的方式挑最好的队伍呢？那么每个球员的"价格"取决于一件事——他们对整个队伍的帮助有多大，而不是他们单独有多厉害。而米勒说：你的队伍穿红色球衣还是蓝色球衣不重要——重要的是他们打得多好。
