## Two Ideas That Changed Two Fields

Franco Modigliani made two contributions so fundamental that either alone would have earned a Nobel Prize. The first — the life-cycle hypothesis — explained why people save and how saving relates to age, income, and national wealth. The second — the Modigliani-Miller theorem — proved that in a perfect market, how a company finances itself is irrelevant to its value. One reshaped macroeconomics; the other founded modern corporate finance.

## The Life-Cycle Hypothesis: Saving for the Long Haul

Why do people save? Keynes said it depends on current income — earn more, save more. Friedman said it depends on permanent income. Modigliani offered a deeper answer: people save because they know they'll eventually retire.

The **life-cycle hypothesis** (developed with Richard Brumberg in the 1950s) models a person's entire financial life:

- **Young adulthood**: Income is low, you may borrow (student loans, mortgages). Saving is negative or minimal
- **Peak earning years**: Income exceeds consumption. You save aggressively — building a nest egg for retirement
- **Retirement**: Income drops to zero (or near it). You draw down your accumulated savings to maintain your standard of living
- **Death**: Ideally, savings are exhausted (or left as a bequest)

The pattern traces a hump shape: wealth accumulates during working years and decumulates during retirement. At the individual level, this is intuitive. But Modigliani showed it has profound macroeconomic implications:

- **National saving depends on demographics**: A country with many young workers saves a lot; a country with many retirees saves little. Population growth and age structure drive national saving rates
- **Economic growth increases saving**: In a growing economy, the young (who are saving) earn more than the old (who are dissaving), so aggregate saving is positive even if each individual's lifetime saving nets to zero
- **Social Security reduces private saving**: Government pensions substitute for private retirement saving — explaining why countries with generous pension systems have lower private saving rates
- **Wealth-to-income ratios are predictable**: The ratio of national wealth to national income depends on the length of retirement relative to working life and the rate of economic growth

## The Modigliani-Miller Theorem: Capital Structure Doesn't Matter

In 1958, Modigliani and Merton Miller published a paper that stunned the finance world. The conventional wisdom held that a company could increase its value by finding the right mix of debt and equity — the optimal capital structure. Modigliani and Miller proved the opposite.

**Proposition I** (Capital Structure Irrelevance): In a perfect market — no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, no asymmetric information — the total value of a firm is determined solely by its earning power and the risk of its underlying assets. Whether it finances itself with 100% equity, 100% debt, or any mix in between makes no difference. The size of the pie doesn't change when you cut it differently.

The intuition: imagine two identical firms generating identical cash flows. One is financed entirely by equity; the other uses half debt, half equity. An investor can replicate the returns of either firm by adjusting their own portfolio — borrowing personally to lever up, or mixing stocks and bonds to lever down. Since investors can create any capital structure on their own, the firm's choice of capital structure can't create value.

**Proposition II**: The cost of equity rises linearly with the debt-to-equity ratio. As a firm takes on more debt, equity becomes riskier (because debt holders get paid first), so shareholders demand a higher return. The cheaper cost of debt is exactly offset by the higher cost of equity — the weighted average cost of capital stays constant.

**Dividend Irrelevance**: In a later paper, Modigliani and Miller extended the logic: dividend policy doesn't matter either. A dollar paid as dividends reduces the stock price by exactly one dollar. Investors who want cash can sell shares; investors who want growth can reinvest dividends. The firm's dividend policy is irrelevant.

## Why "Irrelevance" Is So Relevant

The MM theorem seems to say nothing matters — but that's precisely its power. By establishing what's true in a perfect world, it tells us exactly where to look in the real world:

- **Taxes matter**: Interest on debt is tax-deductible, creating a tax shield that makes debt cheaper. This is why real firms use debt
- **Bankruptcy costs matter**: Too much debt increases the risk of financial distress, which destroys value. This creates an optimal capital structure
- **Information asymmetry matters**: Managers know more than investors. Issuing equity may signal that managers think the stock is overvalued. This explains why firms prefer internal funds, then debt, then equity (the pecking order theory)

The MM theorem is the starting point of all modern corporate finance — not because it describes reality, but because it provides the benchmark against which reality is measured.

His 1985 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his pioneering analyses of saving and of financial markets."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you're saving up for a bicycle. When you're young, you have no money. During your working years (doing chores), you save every week. When you retire from chores, you spend your savings on the bike. That's the life-cycle hypothesis — people save when they work and spend when they don't. Now imagine a pizza. Does it matter whether you cut it into 6 slices or 8? You still have the same amount of pizza. That's the MM theorem — a company's value is like the pizza. How you slice it between debt and equity doesn't change how much pizza there is.

## 改变两个领域的两个思想

莫迪利安尼做出了两项如此根本性的贡献，任何一项单独拿出来都足以获得诺贝尔奖。第一项——生命周期假说——解释了人们为何储蓄，以及储蓄如何与年龄、收入和国民财富相关。第二项——莫迪利安尼-米勒定理——证明了在完美市场中，企业的融资方式与其价值无关。一个重塑了宏观经济学，另一个奠定了现代公司金融学。

## 生命周期假说：为长远而储蓄

人们为什么储蓄？凯恩斯说取决于当期收入——赚得多就存得多。弗里德曼说取决于持久收入。莫迪利安尼给出了更深层的答案：人们储蓄是因为他们知道自己终将退休。

**生命周期假说**（1950年代与理查德·布伦伯格合作发展）模拟了一个人的整个财务生命：

- **青年时期**：收入低，可能借贷（学生贷款、房贷）。储蓄为负或极少
- **收入高峰期**：收入超过消费。积极储蓄——为退休积累储备金
- **退休期**：收入降至零（或接近零）。动用积累的储蓄来维持生活水平
- **去世**：理想情况下，储蓄耗尽（或作为遗产留下）

这一模式呈驼峰形：财富在工作年份积累，在退休年份消耗。在个人层面，这很直观。但莫迪利安尼证明它有深远的宏观经济含义：

- **国民储蓄取决于人口结构**：年轻工人多的国家储蓄多；退休人员多的国家储蓄少。人口增长和年龄结构驱动国民储蓄率
- **经济增长提高储蓄**：在增长的经济中，年轻人（在储蓄）比老年人（在消耗储蓄）赚得多，因此即使每个人一生的储蓄净值为零，总储蓄也是正的
- **社会保障减少私人储蓄**：政府养老金替代了私人退休储蓄——解释了为什么养老金制度慷慨的国家私人储蓄率较低
- **财富收入比是可预测的**：国民财富与国民收入的比率取决于退休期相对于工作期的长度和经济增长率

## 莫迪利安尼-米勒定理：资本结构无关紧要

1958年，莫迪利安尼和默顿·米勒发表了一篇震惊金融界的论文。传统观点认为企业可以通过找到债务和股权的最佳组合——最优资本结构——来增加价值。莫迪利安尼和米勒证明了相反的结论。

**命题I**（资本结构无关性）：在完美市场中——没有税收、没有破产成本、没有信息不对称——企业的总价值完全由其盈利能力和基础资产的风险决定。无论它用100%股权、100%债务还是任何组合来融资都没有区别。换一种方式切蛋糕不会改变蛋糕的大小。

**命题II**：股权成本随债务股权比线性上升。当企业承担更多债务时，股权变得更有风险（因为债权人优先获得偿付），股东要求更高的回报。较低的债务成本恰好被较高的股权成本抵消——加权平均资本成本保持不变。

**股利无关性**：在后续论文中，莫迪利安尼和米勒将逻辑延伸：股利政策也无关紧要。作为股利支付的一元钱恰好使股价降低一元。想要现金的投资者可以卖出股票；想要增长的投资者可以再投资股利。

## 为什么"无关性"如此重要

MM定理似乎在说什么都不重要——但这恰恰是它的力量所在。通过确立在完美世界中什么是成立的，它精确地告诉我们在现实世界中该关注什么：

- **税收很重要**：债务利息可以抵税，创造了使债务更便宜的税盾。这就是现实中企业使用债务的原因
- **破产成本很重要**：过多债务增加了财务困境的风险，会摧毁价值。这创造了最优资本结构
- **信息不对称很重要**：管理者比投资者知道更多。发行股权可能暗示管理者认为股票被高估。这解释了为什么企业偏好内部资金，其次是债务，最后才是股权（优序融资理论）

MM定理是所有现代公司金融学的起点——不是因为它描述了现实，而是因为它提供了衡量现实的基准。

他1985年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对储蓄和金融市场的开创性分析。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你在攒钱买一辆自行车。小时候你没有钱。在你工作的年份（做家务），你每周都存钱。当你从家务中"退休"时，你花掉积蓄买自行车。这就是生命周期假说——人们工作时储蓄，不工作时花费。现在想象一个披萨。把它切成6块还是8块有区别吗？你拥有的披萨总量是一样的。这就是MM定理——企业的价值就像披萨。你怎么在债务和股权之间切分它，不会改变披萨有多大。
