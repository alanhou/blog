## Abstract

Feature engineering has long been recognized as a critical bottleneck in machine learning pipelines, particularly for tabular data where the optimal feature space grows exponentially and traditionally requires substantial domain expertise. FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt) addresses this challenge by introducing the first agentic ReAct framework specifically designed for automated feature engineering across both regression and classification tasks. The system autonomously explores, generates, and refines features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within a unified agent architecture. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on regression tasks with an average 2.0% RMSE reduction, and competitive performance on classification tasks with 0.23% average ROC-AUC improvement on datasets exceeding 10K instances, while maintaining superior robustness to errors compared to existing approaches.

## Key Contributions

- First application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering for both regression and classification tasks
- Integration of feature generation, selection, and evaluation within a unified agent architecture that iteratively learns from success and failure
- State-of-the-art performance on regression benchmarks with 2.0% average RMSE reduction
- Competitive classification performance with 0.23% ROC-AUC improvement on large-scale datasets (>10K instances)
- Enhanced robustness to errors through the ReAct paradigm's ability to record and learn from feature discovery attempts

## The ReAct Paradigm for Feature Engineering

The core innovation of FAMOSE lies in its adaptation of the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) paradigm to the feature engineering domain. Traditional automated feature engineering approaches operate in a feed-forward manner, generating features without the ability to reflect on their effectiveness. FAMOSE, by contrast, implements an iterative cycle where the agent:

1. **Reasons** about which features might be valuable based on data characteristics and previous attempts
2. **Acts** by generating candidate features using domain-agnostic transformations
3. **Observes** the impact of these features through integrated evaluation tools
4. **Reflects** on outcomes to guide subsequent feature generation

This cyclical process effectively creates a form of in-context learning where the LLM's context window accumulates knowledge about successful and unsuccessful feature engineering strategies. The authors hypothesize that this mechanism functions similarly to few-shot prompting, enabling the model to progressively generate more innovative and effective features as the agent explores the feature space.

The ReAct framework allows FAMOSE to maintain a persistent memory of what works and what doesn't, avoiding redundant exploration and focusing computational resources on promising feature engineering directions. This is particularly valuable in the exponentially large feature space where exhaustive search is computationally prohibitive.

## Experimental Results and Performance Analysis

FAMOSE's experimental validation spans multiple benchmark datasets for both regression and classification tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods:

**Regression Performance**: FAMOSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an average 2.0% reduction in RMSE across regression benchmarks. This improvement is particularly notable because regression tasks often require more nuanced feature relationships to capture continuous target variables accurately.

**Classification Performance**: On classification tasks, FAMOSE shows strong performance with an average 0.23% ROC-AUC improvement on datasets with more than 10,000 instances. The performance gain is more pronounced on larger datasets, suggesting that FAMOSE's iterative exploration benefits from having more data to evaluate feature effectiveness.

**Robustness**: A critical advantage of FAMOSE is its superior robustness to errors compared to competing algorithms. The ReAct framework's ability to recover from unsuccessful feature generation attempts and adjust its strategy makes it more reliable in production scenarios where data quality and distribution may vary.

The performance characteristics suggest that FAMOSE's strength lies not just in generating individual high-quality features, but in its ability to systematically explore the feature space and learn from the exploration process itself.

## Implications for AI-Driven Problem Solving

FAMOSE's success provides compelling evidence for a broader thesis: AI agents employing reasoning-action cycles are remarkably effective at solving problems requiring highly inventive solutions. Feature engineering is an ideal testbed for this hypothesis because it demands creativity, domain understanding, and the ability to evaluate and iterate on ideas—capabilities traditionally considered uniquely human.

The framework's ability to autonomously discover effective features without domain expertise has several important implications:

**Democratization of ML**: By reducing the dependency on domain experts for feature engineering, FAMOSE lowers the barrier to entry for applying machine learning to new domains and problems.

**Scalability**: The automated nature of FAMOSE enables feature engineering at scale across multiple datasets and domains simultaneously, something impractical with manual approaches.

**Innovation**: The iterative exploration enabled by ReAct may discover non-obvious feature combinations that human experts might overlook, potentially leading to novel insights about data relationships.

**Generalization**: The domain-agnostic nature of FAMOSE's approach suggests that similar agentic frameworks could be applied to other creative problem-solving tasks in machine learning and beyond.

## Takeaways

1. FAMOSE represents the first successful application of the ReAct agentic framework to automated feature engineering, achieving state-of-the-art regression performance and competitive classification results.

2. The iterative reasoning-action cycle enables the LLM to learn from feature engineering attempts within its context window, functioning as a form of dynamic few-shot learning that improves feature quality over time.

3. Performance gains are most pronounced on larger datasets (>10K instances) and regression tasks, with 2.0% average RMSE reduction and 0.23% ROC-AUC improvement respectively.

4. FAMOSE demonstrates superior robustness to errors compared to existing automated feature engineering approaches, making it more suitable for production deployments.

5. The success of FAMOSE provides evidence that AI agents with reasoning capabilities can effectively solve highly creative problems like feature engineering that traditionally required substantial human expertise and intuition.

## 摘要

特征工程长期以来被认为是机器学习流程中的关键瓶颈,特别是对于表格数据,最优特征空间呈指数级增长,传统上需要大量的领域专业知识。FAMOSE(特征增强与最优选择智能体)通过引入首个专门针对回归和分类任务的自动化特征工程ReAct智能体框架来应对这一挑战。该系统在统一的智能体架构中自主探索、生成和优化特征,同时集成特征选择和评估工具。实验结果表明,在回归任务上达到最优性能,平均RMSE降低2.0%,在分类任务上表现出色,对于超过1万个实例的数据集平均ROC-AUC提升0.23%,同时相比现有方法保持更优的错误鲁棒性。

## 主要贡献

- 首次将ReAct智能体框架应用于回归和分类任务的自动化特征工程
- 在统一的智能体架构中集成特征生成、选择和评估,通过迭代从成功和失败中学习
- 在回归基准测试中达到最优性能,平均RMSE降低2.0%
- 在大规模数据集(>10K实例)上的分类性能表现出色,ROC-AUC提升0.23%
- 通过ReAct范式记录和学习特征发现尝试的能力,增强了对错误的鲁棒性

## 面向特征工程的ReAct范式

FAMOSE的核心创新在于将ReAct(推理与行动)范式适配到特征工程领域。传统的自动化特征工程方法以前馈方式运行,生成特征时无法反思其有效性。相比之下,FAMOSE实现了一个迭代循环,智能体在其中:

1. **推理**基于数据特征和先前尝试,判断哪些特征可能有价值
2. **行动**使用领域无关的转换生成候选特征
3. **观察**通过集成的评估工具观察这些特征的影响
4. **反思**结果以指导后续特征生成

这种循环过程有效地创建了一种上下文学习形式,其中LLM的上下文窗口积累了关于成功和失败特征工程策略的知识。作者假设这种机制的功能类似于少样本提示,使模型能够随着智能体探索特征空间而逐步生成更具创新性和有效性的特征。

ReAct框架使FAMOSE能够保持对有效和无效方法的持久记忆,避免冗余探索,将计算资源集中在有前景的特征工程方向上。这在指数级大的特征空间中特别有价值,因为穷举搜索在计算上是不可行的。

## 实验结果与性能分析

FAMOSE的实验验证涵盖了回归和分类任务的多个基准数据集,展示了相对于基线方法的一致性改进:

**回归性能**: FAMOSE在回归基准测试中达到最优结果,平均RMSE降低2.0%。这一改进尤其值得注意,因为回归任务通常需要更细致的特征关系来准确捕获连续目标变量。

**分类性能**: 在分类任务上,FAMOSE在超过10,000个实例的数据集上表现出色,平均ROC-AUC提升0.23%。性能提升在更大的数据集上更为明显,表明FAMOSE的迭代探索受益于有更多数据来评估特征有效性。

**鲁棒性**: FAMOSE的一个关键优势是相比竞争算法具有更优的错误鲁棒性。ReAct框架从不成功的特征生成尝试中恢复并调整策略的能力,使其在数据质量和分布可能变化的生产场景中更加可靠。

性能特征表明,FAMOSE的优势不仅在于生成单个高质量特征,还在于其系统性探索特征空间并从探索过程本身学习的能力。

## 对AI驱动问题解决的启示

FAMOSE的成功为一个更广泛的论点提供了有力证据:采用推理-行动循环的AI智能体在解决需要高度创造性解决方案的问题时非常有效。特征工程是验证这一假设的理想试验场,因为它需要创造力、领域理解以及评估和迭代想法的能力——这些能力传统上被认为是人类独有的。

该框架在没有领域专业知识的情况下自主发现有效特征的能力具有几个重要意义:

**机器学习民主化**: 通过减少对领域专家进行特征工程的依赖,FAMOSE降低了将机器学习应用于新领域和问题的门槛。

**可扩展性**: FAMOSE的自动化特性使得能够同时在多个数据集和领域上大规模进行特征工程,这在手动方法中是不切实际的。

**创新性**: ReAct启用的迭代探索可能发现人类专家可能忽略的非显而易见的特征组合,潜在地带来关于数据关系的新见解。

**泛化能力**: FAMOSE方法的领域无关性质表明,类似的智能体框架可以应用于机器学习及其他领域的其他创造性问题解决任务。
