## The Economist Who Asked "What Is a Good Life?"

Most economists measure welfare with money — GDP per capita, income, consumption. Amartya Sen asked a deeper question: **what can people actually do and be?** A wealthy person in a dictatorship and a poor person in a free society may have the same income, but their lives are fundamentally different. A woman with high earnings but no right to own property is not truly well-off. Income measures purchasing power; it doesn't measure freedom.

Sen brought philosophy back into economics — not as decoration, but as foundation. His work spans social choice theory, welfare economics, poverty measurement, and the analysis of famine. In each area, he challenged conventional wisdom and offered richer, more humane alternatives.

## The Capability Approach: Freedom as the Measure of Development

Sen's most influential idea is the **capability approach** — a framework for evaluating human well-being that focuses not on what people have, but on what they can do and become.

Key concepts:

- **Functionings**: The things a person actually does or is — being well-nourished, being educated, participating in community life, having self-respect. These are the building blocks of a good life
- **Capabilities**: The set of functionings a person can choose from — their real freedoms. A person who fasts by choice has the same functioning (not eating) as a starving person, but vastly different capability
- **Development as freedom**: Economic development should be measured not by GDP growth but by the expansion of people's capabilities — their real opportunities to live lives they value

This framework transformed development economics:

- The **Human Development Index** (HDI), created by the United Nations based on Sen's work, measures development through life expectancy, education, and income — not income alone
- It explains why countries with similar incomes can have vastly different quality of life — Kerala in India has life expectancy comparable to rich countries despite low income, because of investments in health and education
- It shifts policy focus from growth to what growth enables — education, health, political participation, gender equality

## Poverty and Famines: An Entitlement Theory

As a nine-year-old boy in Bengal, Sen witnessed the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, which killed three million people. This experience shaped his life's work. In *Poverty and Famines* (1981), he overturned the conventional explanation of famine.

**The conventional view**: Famines are caused by food shortages — not enough food to go around.

**Sen's view**: Famines can occur — and have occurred — without any decline in food supply. The Bengal famine happened during a year of normal food production. The problem wasn't the amount of food; it was who could access it.

The **entitlement approach**: A person's ability to eat depends on their "entitlement set" — the food they can command through:

- **Production**: Growing their own food
- **Trade**: Buying food with their income
- **Labor**: Working for food or wages
- **Transfer**: Receiving food from the state or community

Famine occurs when a large group's entitlements collapse — not necessarily because food disappears, but because their ability to acquire food is destroyed. In Bengal, wartime inflation and speculative hoarding drove food prices beyond the reach of rural laborers, even as food was available in markets.

The policy implications were revolutionary:

- **Democracy prevents famine**: Sen showed that no functioning democracy with a free press has ever experienced a major famine. Democratic accountability forces governments to act; free media provides early warning
- **Entitlement protection, not just food supply**: Famine prevention requires protecting people's ability to buy food — through employment programs, price controls, or direct transfers — not just increasing food production
- **Information matters**: Famines are often worsened by government denial or information suppression. Transparency saves lives

## Social Choice Theory: Beyond Arrow's Impossibility

Kenneth Arrow had proved in 1951 that no voting system can satisfy a set of reasonable conditions simultaneously — the impossibility theorem. This seemed to doom social choice theory — the study of how individual preferences can be aggregated into collective decisions.

Sen showed a way forward. His contributions:

- **The liberal paradox** (1970): Sen proved that there is a fundamental conflict between individual liberty and Pareto efficiency. Even minimal individual rights — like the right to choose what you read — can conflict with the principle that society should prefer outcomes that make everyone better off. This revealed a deep tension in liberal philosophy that economists had ignored
- **Expanding the informational basis**: Arrow's impossibility arises partly because his framework allows only ordinal rankings (A is preferred to B) with no interpersonal comparisons. Sen showed that by allowing richer information — partial comparability of well-being across people — many impossibility results dissolve. We can make meaningful social choices if we're willing to use more information about people's situations
- **Poverty and inequality measurement**: Sen developed axiomatic approaches to measuring poverty and inequality — including the **Sen poverty index**, which captures not just how many people are poor but how poor they are and how unequal poverty is among the poor

## Welfare Economics Restored

Before Sen, welfare economics was in crisis. Arrow's impossibility theorem and the rejection of interpersonal utility comparisons had left the field with almost nothing to say about social welfare. Sen rebuilt it:

- **Beyond utility**: Welfare shouldn't be measured by subjective satisfaction alone. A person who has adapted to deprivation may report high satisfaction — but they're still deprived. Objective capabilities matter
- **Beyond income**: Two people with the same income may have vastly different well-being — due to disability, gender discrimination, or lack of public services. Income is a means, not an end
- **Beyond efficiency**: Pareto efficiency says nothing about distribution. An economy where one person has everything and everyone else has nothing is Pareto efficient. Sen insisted that economics must address justice, not just efficiency

His 1998 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his contributions to welfare economics."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine two kids both get $10 allowance. One lives near a library, a park, and a doctor. The other lives where there are no books, no playground, and no hospital. They have the same money, but their lives are completely different. Amartya Sen said: don't just count the money — count what people can actually do with their lives. Can they read? Can they stay healthy? Can they speak freely? He also solved a big mystery about hunger: sometimes people starve even when there's plenty of food around — because they can't afford to buy it. It's not about how much food exists; it's about who can get it.

## 追问"什么是美好生活"的经济学家

大多数经济学家用金钱衡量福利——人均GDP、收入、消费。森问了一个更深层的问题：**人们实际上能做什么、能成为什么？** 一个独裁国家的富人和一个自由社会的穷人可能有相同的收入，但他们的生活根本不同。一个收入很高但没有财产权的女性并非真正富裕。收入衡量购买力；它不衡量自由。

森将哲学重新带回经济学——不是作为装饰，而是作为基础。他的工作横跨社会选择理论、福利经济学、贫困测量和饥荒分析。在每个领域，他都挑战了传统智慧，提供了更丰富、更人性化的替代方案。

---

## 能力方法：以自由衡量发展

森最有影响力的思想是**能力方法**——一个评估人类福祉的框架，关注的不是人们拥有什么，而是他们能做什么、能成为什么。

核心概念：

- **功能**：一个人实际做的或所是的——营养良好、受过教育、参与社区生活、拥有自尊。这些是美好生活的基石
- **能力**：一个人可以选择的功能集合——他们的真实自由。一个自愿禁食的人和一个饥饿的人有相同的功能（不吃东西），但能力截然不同
- **发展即自由**：经济发展不应以GDP增长来衡量，而应以人们能力的扩展来衡量——他们过上自己珍视的生活的真实机会

这一框架改变了发展经济学：

- 联合国基于森的工作创建的**人类发展指数**（HDI），通过预期寿命、教育和收入来衡量发展——而非仅仅是收入
- 它解释了为什么收入相似的国家生活质量可以截然不同——印度喀拉拉邦尽管收入低，但预期寿命可与富裕国家相比，因为在健康和教育上的投资
- 它将政策焦点从增长转向增长所能实现的——教育、健康、政治参与、性别平等

## 贫困与饥荒：权利理论

森九岁时在孟加拉目睹了1943年的孟加拉大饥荒，那场饥荒夺去了三百万人的生命。这段经历塑造了他毕生的工作。在《贫困与饥荒》（1981年）中，他推翻了对饥荒的传统解释。

**传统观点**：饥荒由食物短缺引起——食物不够分。

**森的观点**：饥荒可以在食物供应没有任何下降的情况下发生——而且确实发生过。孟加拉饥荒发生在粮食产量正常的年份。问题不在于食物的数量，而在于谁能获得它。

**权利方法**：一个人的进食能力取决于他们的"权利集"——他们能通过以下途径获得的食物：

- **生产**：自己种植食物
- **贸易**：用收入购买食物
- **劳动**：为食物或工资工作
- **转移**：从国家或社区获得食物

饥荒发生在一大群人的权利崩溃时——不一定是因为食物消失了，而是因为他们获取食物的能力被摧毁了。在孟加拉，战时通胀和投机囤积将食物价格推到了农村劳动者无法承受的水平，即使市场上有食物可供出售。

政策含义是革命性的：

- **民主防止饥荒**：森证明没有任何一个拥有自由媒体的运作中的民主国家经历过重大饥荒。民主问责迫使政府行动；自由媒体提供预警
- **保护权利，而非仅仅增加食物供应**：预防饥荒需要保护人们购买食物的能力——通过就业计划、价格管控或直接转移——而非仅仅增加粮食产量
- **信息很重要**：饥荒常因政府否认或信息压制而恶化。透明拯救生命

## 社会选择理论：超越阿罗不可能性

阿罗在1951年证明没有投票系统能同时满足一组合理条件——不可能性定理。这似乎宣判了社会选择理论的死刑——研究个人偏好如何汇总为集体决策的学科。

森找到了出路。他的贡献：

- **自由主义悖论**（1970年）：森证明个人自由与帕累托效率之间存在根本冲突。即使是最低限度的个人权利——比如选择读什么书的权利——也可能与社会应偏好使每个人都更好的结果这一原则相冲突。这揭示了经济学家忽视的自由主义哲学中的深层张力
- **扩展信息基础**：阿罗的不可能性部分源于其框架只允许序数排名（A优于B），不允许人际比较。森证明通过允许更丰富的信息——人们福祉之间的部分可比性——许多不可能性结果就消解了。如果我们愿意使用更多关于人们处境的信息，就可以做出有意义的社会选择
- **贫困与不平等测量**：森发展了测量贫困和不平等的公理化方法——包括**森贫困指数**，它不仅捕捉有多少人贫困，还捕捉他们有多贫困以及穷人之间的不平等程度

## 福利经济学的重建

在森之前，福利经济学处于危机中。阿罗的不可能性定理和对人际效用比较的拒绝使该领域几乎无话可说。森重建了它：

- **超越效用**：福利不应仅以主观满意度来衡量。一个已经适应了匮乏的人可能报告高满意度——但他们仍然是匮乏的。客观能力很重要
- **超越收入**：两个收入相同的人可能福祉截然不同——由于残疾、性别歧视或缺乏公共服务。收入是手段，不是目的
- **超越效率**：帕累托效率对分配无话可说。一个人拥有一切而其他人一无所有的经济是帕累托有效的。森坚持经济学必须关注正义，而非仅仅是效率

他1998年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对福利经济学的贡献。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象两个孩子都得到10元零花钱。一个住在图书馆、公园和医院附近。另一个住在没有书、没有游乐场、没有医院的地方。他们有同样的钱，但生活完全不同。森说：不要只数钱——要看人们的生活实际上能做什么。他们能读书吗？能保持健康吗？能自由说话吗？他还解开了一个关于饥饿的大谜团：有时候即使周围有很多食物，人们也会挨饿——因为他们买不起。问题不在于有多少食物存在，而在于谁能得到它。
