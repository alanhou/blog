## The Paradox of Simultaneous Shortage and Surplus

Standard economics has a simple story about markets: if there's a surplus of workers (unemployment), wages fall until every worker finds a job. If there's a shortage of workers (vacancies), wages rise until every job is filled. Supply meets demand, and the market clears.

But labor markets never clear. There are always unemployed workers and unfilled jobs at the same time. In the United States, even during economic booms, millions of people are unemployed while millions of jobs sit vacant. This isn't a temporary glitch — it's a permanent feature of every economy.

Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides explained why. Their answer: **search frictions** — the time, effort, and cost required for workers to find suitable jobs and for firms to find suitable workers. This simple insight, developed into a rigorous mathematical framework, became the foundation of modern labor economics.

## Diamond: Search Externalities and Market Failure

Peter Diamond laid the theoretical foundations by showing that **search frictions fundamentally change how markets work.**

In a frictionless market, prices adjust instantly to balance supply and demand. But when searching is costly, something different happens:

- **Thick market externalities**: The more people participate in a market, the easier it is for everyone to find a match. A job seeker in a city with many employers finds work faster than one in a small town. An employer in a thick labor market fills vacancies faster. Each participant's search makes everyone else's search easier — a positive externality
- **Multiple equilibria**: Diamond showed that search markets can get stuck in bad equilibria. If few people are searching, matches are rare, so even fewer people bother to search — a vicious cycle. Conversely, if many people search, matches are frequent, encouraging even more search — a virtuous cycle. The same economy can settle into a high-activity or low-activity equilibrium
- **The coconut model**: Diamond's famous "coconut economy" parable showed that even identical people trading identical goods can end up with inefficient outcomes when search is costly. The market doesn't automatically find the right level of activity

This meant that unemployment wasn't just about wages being too high or too low — it was about the fundamental difficulty of matching in a decentralized economy.

## Mortensen: Job Creation and Destruction

Dale Mortensen focused on the dynamics of job creation and destruction — the constant churning that characterizes real labor markets.

Key insights:

- **The matching function**: Mortensen (with Pissarides) formalized the idea that the rate at which unemployed workers and vacant jobs find each other depends on the number of each — more unemployed workers and more vacancies mean more matches, but with diminishing returns
- **Wage determination**: When a worker and firm meet, they must agree on a wage. Mortensen modeled this as a **Nash bargaining** problem — the wage splits the surplus from the match between worker and firm, with the split depending on each side's outside options
- **On-the-job search**: Workers don't just search when unemployed — they search while employed too, looking for better matches. This generates job-to-job transitions that are crucial for wage growth and efficient allocation
- **Wage dispersion**: Even identical workers doing identical jobs can earn different wages — because the randomness of search means some workers happen to find better-paying firms. This explained the persistent wage inequality that competitive models couldn't account for

## Pissarides: The DMP Model

Christopher Pissarides synthesized these ideas into the **DMP model** (Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides) — the workhorse framework of modern labor economics.

The model captures the essential dynamics:

- **Firms decide whether to post vacancies** based on the expected cost of searching for a worker versus the expected profit from a filled position
- **Workers decide how intensively to search** based on the expected benefit of finding a job versus the cost of searching
- **A matching function** determines how many matches occur given the number of vacancies and unemployed workers
- **Wages are bargained** when a match forms, splitting the surplus between worker and firm
- **Jobs are destroyed** when productivity shocks make them unprofitable

The **Beveridge curve** — the empirical relationship between unemployment and vacancies — emerges naturally from the model. When the economy is booming, vacancies are high and unemployment is low. When it's in recession, vacancies are low and unemployment is high. But both always coexist, because matching takes time.

## Policy Implications

The DMP model became the standard tool for analyzing labor market policies:

- **Unemployment benefits**: More generous benefits reduce the cost of being unemployed, making workers pickier about which jobs to accept. This can improve match quality (workers find better-suited jobs) but also increase unemployment duration. The optimal level balances these effects
- **Employment protection**: Strict firing regulations reduce job destruction but also discourage job creation — firms are reluctant to hire if they can't fire. The net effect on unemployment is ambiguous
- **Active labor market policies**: Job placement services, training programs, and hiring subsidies can improve the matching process — reducing frictions directly rather than just compensating for them
- **The Beveridge curve as diagnostic**: Shifts in the Beveridge curve reveal whether unemployment is cyclical (moving along the curve) or structural (the curve itself has shifted, indicating worse matching efficiency)

Their 2010 Nobel Prize was awarded "for their analysis of markets with search frictions."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine a school dance where boys stand on one side and girls on the other. Everyone wants to dance, and there are equal numbers of boys and girls. In a perfect world, everyone pairs up instantly. But in reality, it takes time — you have to walk across the room, find someone you like, ask them, maybe get turned down, try again. Some kids are shy. Some are picky. The music is loud and it's hard to communicate. So at any moment, there are kids standing alone AND kids looking for partners — both at the same time. That's what happens in the job market: workers are looking for jobs and companies are looking for workers, but finding the right match takes time and effort. Diamond, Mortensen, and Pissarides built the math to explain this dance — and to figure out how to make the matching go faster.

## 同时短缺与过剩的悖论

标准经济学对市场有一个简单的故事：如果工人过剩（失业），工资下降直到每个工人找到工作。如果工人短缺（职位空缺），工资上升直到每个职位被填满。供给遇到需求，市场出清。

但劳动市场从不出清。失业工人和未填补的职位总是同时存在。在美国，即使在经济繁荣期间，数百万人失业而数百万职位空缺。这不是暂时的故障——而是每个经济体的永久特征。

戴蒙德、莫滕森和皮萨里德斯解释了原因。他们的答案：**搜索摩擦**——工人找到合适工作和企业找到合适工人所需的时间、精力和成本。这一简单洞见被发展为严谨的数学框架，成为现代劳动经济学的基础。

## 戴蒙德：搜索外部性与市场失灵

戴蒙德奠定了理论基础，证明**搜索摩擦从根本上改变了市场的运作方式。**

在无摩擦的市场中，价格即时调整以平衡供需。但当搜索有成本时，情况不同了：

- **厚市场外部性**：参与市场的人越多，每个人越容易找到匹配。在有许多雇主的城市，求职者更快找到工作。在厚劳动市场中，雇主更快填补空缺。每个参与者的搜索使其他人的搜索更容易——正外部性
- **多重均衡**：戴蒙德证明搜索市场可能陷入坏均衡。如果搜索的人少，匹配稀少，所以更少的人费心搜索——恶性循环。相反，如果许多人搜索，匹配频繁，鼓励更多搜索——良性循环。同一经济体可以稳定在高活动或低活动均衡
- **椰子模型**：戴蒙德著名的"椰子经济"寓言表明，即使是交易相同商品的相同人，当搜索有成本时也可能产生低效结果。市场不会自动找到正确的活动水平

这意味着失业不仅仅是工资太高或太低的问题——而是去中心化经济中匹配的根本困难。

## 莫滕森：工作创造与毁灭

莫滕森专注于工作创造和毁灭的动态——真实劳动市场的持续流转特征。

关键洞见：

- **匹配函数**：莫滕森（与皮萨里德斯）形式化了这一思想：失业工人和空缺职位互相找到的速率取决于各自的数量——更多失业工人和更多空缺意味着更多匹配，但收益递减
- **工资决定**：当工人和企业相遇时，他们必须就工资达成一致。莫滕森将此建模为**纳什讨价还价**问题——工资在工人和企业之间分配匹配的剩余，分配比例取决于各方的外部选择
- **在职搜索**：工人不仅在失业时搜索——他们在就业时也搜索，寻找更好的匹配。这产生了对工资增长和有效配置至关重要的工作间转换
- **工资离散**：即使是做相同工作的相同工人也可能赚取不同工资——因为搜索的随机性意味着一些工人碰巧找到了薪酬更高的企业。这解释了竞争模型无法解释的持续工资不平等

## 皮萨里德斯：DMP模型

皮萨里德斯将这些思想综合为**DMP模型**（戴蒙德-莫滕森-皮萨里德斯）——现代劳动经济学的主力框架。

该模型捕捉了基本动态：

- **企业决定是否发布空缺**，基于搜索工人的预期成本与填补职位的预期利润
- **工人决定搜索的强度**，基于找到工作的预期收益与搜索成本
- **匹配函数**决定给定空缺数和失业工人数时产生多少匹配
- **工资在匹配形成时讨价还价**，在工人和企业之间分配剩余
- **工作在生产率冲击使其无利可图时被毁灭**

**贝弗里奇曲线**——失业与空缺之间的经验关系——自然地从模型中产生。经济繁荣时，空缺高而失业低。衰退时，空缺低而失业高。但两者总是共存，因为匹配需要时间。

## 政策含义

DMP模型成为分析劳动市场政策的标准工具：

- **失业救济金**：更慷慨的救济金降低了失业的成本，使工人对接受哪些工作更挑剔。这可以提高匹配质量（工人找到更合适的工作）但也增加失业持续时间。最优水平平衡这些效应
- **就业保护**：严格的解雇法规减少工作毁灭但也抑制工作创造——如果不能解雇，企业不愿雇用。对失业的净效应是模糊的
- **积极劳动市场政策**：就业安置服务、培训项目和雇用补贴可以改善匹配过程——直接减少摩擦而非仅仅补偿它们
- **贝弗里奇曲线作为诊断工具**：贝弗里奇曲线的移动揭示失业是周期性的（沿曲线移动）还是结构性的（曲线本身移动，表明匹配效率恶化）

他们2010年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对存在搜索摩擦的市场的分析。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象一个学校舞会，男孩站一边，女孩站另一边。每个人都想跳舞，男孩和女孩人数相等。在完美世界里，每个人立刻配对。但现实中需要时间——你得走过房间，找到你喜欢的人，邀请他们，也许被拒绝，再试一次。有些孩子害羞。有些很挑剔。音乐很响，很难沟通。所以在任何时刻，都有孩子独自站着，同时也有孩子在找舞伴——两者同时存在。这就是劳动市场发生的事：工人在找工作，公司在找工人，但找到合适的匹配需要时间和精力。戴蒙德、莫滕森和皮萨里德斯建立了解释这场舞会的数学——并弄清楚如何让匹配更快。
