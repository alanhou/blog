## The Problem with Early Econometrics

By the 1930s, economists had plenty of theories and plenty of data. What they lacked was a rigorous way to connect the two. Early econometricians fitted equations to data using methods borrowed from the natural sciences — but without asking fundamental questions: What does it mean for economic data to "confirm" a theory? How do we account for the fact that economic variables are determined simultaneously? When can we trust our estimates, and when are they hopelessly biased?

Trygve Haavelmo answered these questions in a single doctoral thesis — *The Probability Approach in Econometrics* (1944) — that transformed the field from an ad hoc collection of techniques into a discipline with rigorous logical foundations.

## The Probability Revolution

Before Haavelmo, econometricians treated economic data as if it were generated by a deterministic process with some measurement error sprinkled on top. Fit a line through the data, minimize the errors, and you've found the economic relationship. Simple.

Haavelmo showed this was fundamentally wrong. Economic data is **stochastic** — generated by random processes. The error terms aren't just measurement noise; they represent genuine randomness in economic behavior — the countless small factors that influence decisions but can't be individually modeled.

His key insight: **economic observations should be treated as realizations of random variables governed by a joint probability distribution.** This seemingly abstract shift had enormous practical consequences:

- **Statistical inference becomes possible**: If data comes from a probability distribution, we can use the full machinery of mathematical statistics — hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, maximum likelihood estimation — to draw conclusions about economic relationships
- **We can quantify uncertainty**: Instead of just estimating a number, we can say how confident we are in that estimate. A demand elasticity of -0.5 means something very different if the standard error is 0.01 versus 1.0
- **Model specification matters**: The choice of probability model — which variables to include, what distributional assumptions to make — becomes a substantive economic decision, not just a technical detail

## The Simultaneous Equations Problem

Haavelmo's second great contribution was identifying and solving the **simultaneous equations bias** — a problem that had silently corrupted econometric estimates for decades.

Consider the simplest economic model: supply and demand. Price and quantity are determined simultaneously — the intersection of a supply curve and a demand curve. When you observe market data (prices and quantities), you're seeing equilibrium outcomes, not points on either curve individually.

The devastating implication: **ordinary regression cannot recover either the supply curve or the demand curve from equilibrium data.** If you regress quantity on price, you get a meaningless hybrid — neither supply nor demand — because price is correlated with the error term in both equations. This is simultaneity bias.

Haavelmo formalized this problem and showed:

- **Identification**: Before you can estimate an equation, you must first prove it's identifiable — that the data contains enough information to distinguish it from other equations in the system. Some equations simply cannot be estimated, no matter how much data you have
- **Structural vs. reduced form**: The structural equations (supply and demand) represent the economic theory. The reduced form (price and quantity as functions of exogenous variables only) is what the data can directly reveal. The challenge is recovering structure from reduced form
- **Maximum likelihood estimation**: Haavelmo showed that the correct way to estimate simultaneous systems is through full-information maximum likelihood — estimating all equations jointly, respecting the constraints that the system imposes

## The Identification Problem: When Data Isn't Enough

The identification problem is perhaps Haavelmo's most profound insight. It's not about having too little data — it's about the logical structure of the model.

Imagine you observe price and quantity data for a market. Both supply and demand shift over time due to various factors. If supply shifts but demand stays fixed, the data traces out the demand curve. If demand shifts but supply stays fixed, the data traces out the supply curve. But if both shift simultaneously, the data traces out neither — just a cloud of equilibrium points.

To identify an equation, you need **exclusion restrictions** — variables that affect one equation but not the other. Weather affects agricultural supply but not demand; income affects demand but not supply. These excluded variables provide the leverage needed to disentangle the system.

This framework — identification before estimation — became the methodological foundation of all structural econometrics and remains central to causal inference today.

## Legacy: From Haavelmo to Modern Causal Inference

Haavelmo's work established principles that still guide empirical economics:

- **Causality requires structure**: You can't determine cause and effect from correlations alone. You need a model of how variables are determined — what causes what — and then test whether the data is consistent with that model
- **Instrumental variables**: The practical solution to simultaneity bias — finding variables correlated with the endogenous regressor but uncorrelated with the error — flows directly from Haavelmo's identification framework
- **The credibility revolution**: Modern econometrics' emphasis on research design, natural experiments, and causal identification traces back to Haavelmo's insistence that estimation without identification is meaningless

His 1989 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine you're trying to figure out whether eating ice cream makes people go swimming, or whether going swimming makes people eat ice cream. You notice that on days when lots of ice cream is sold, lots of people swim. But both happen because it's hot outside — the heat causes both. If you just look at the numbers, you might wrongly conclude that ice cream causes swimming. Haavelmo figured out this exact problem in economics — when two things cause each other at the same time, you can't just draw a line through the data and call it an answer. You need a clever trick to untangle what's really causing what.

## 早期计量经济学的问题

到1930年代，经济学家有了大量理论和大量数据。他们缺少的是将两者严谨地联系起来的方法。早期的计量经济学家用从自然科学借来的方法将方程拟合到数据上——但没有追问根本性的问题：经济数据"证实"一个理论意味着什么？我们如何处理经济变量同时被决定的事实？什么时候我们可以信任估计结果，什么时候它们是无可救药地有偏的？

哈维尔莫在一篇博士论文——《计量经济学中的概率方法》（1944年）——中回答了这些问题，将这个领域从一堆临时拼凑的技术转变为一门有严谨逻辑基础的学科。

---

## 概率革命

在哈维尔莫之前，计量经济学家把经济数据当作由确定性过程生成的，只是撒上了一些测量误差。画一条线穿过数据，最小化误差，你就找到了经济关系。就这么简单。

哈维尔莫证明这从根本上是错误的。经济数据是**随机的**——由随机过程生成。误差项不仅仅是测量噪音；它们代表经济行为中真正的随机性——无数影响决策但无法单独建模的小因素。

他的关键洞见：**经济观测值应被视为由联合概率分布支配的随机变量的实现。** 这个看似抽象的转变有巨大的实际后果：

- **统计推断成为可能**：如果数据来自概率分布，我们就可以使用数理统计的全套工具——假设检验、置信区间、最大似然估计——来得出关于经济关系的结论
- **我们可以量化不确定性**：不仅仅是估计一个数字，我们可以说出对该估计有多大信心。需求弹性为-0.5，当标准误为0.01和为1.0时意义完全不同
- **模型设定很重要**：概率模型的选择——包含哪些变量、做什么分布假设——成为实质性的经济决策，而非仅仅是技术细节

## 联立方程问题

哈维尔莫的第二大贡献是识别并解决了**联立方程偏差**——一个数十年来悄悄腐蚀计量经济学估计的问题。

考虑最简单的经济模型：供给和需求。价格和数量同时被决定——供给曲线和需求曲线的交点。当你观察市场数据（价格和数量）时，你看到的是均衡结果，而非单独的任一条曲线上的点。

毁灭性的含义：**普通回归无法从均衡数据中恢复供给曲线或需求曲线。** 如果你将数量对价格做回归，你得到的是一个毫无意义的混合体——既非供给也非需求——因为价格与两个方程的误差项都相关。这就是联立性偏差。

哈维尔莫形式化了这个问题并证明：

- **识别**：在估计一个方程之前，你必须首先证明它是可识别的——数据包含足够的信息来将它与系统中的其他方程区分开来。有些方程根本无法估计，无论你有多少数据
- **结构式与简约式**：结构方程（供给和需求）代表经济理论。简约式（价格和数量仅作为外生变量的函数）是数据能直接揭示的。挑战在于从简约式恢复结构
- **最大似然估计**：哈维尔莫证明估计联立系统的正确方法是全信息最大似然——联合估计所有方程，尊重系统施加的约束

## 识别问题：当数据不够时

识别问题也许是哈维尔莫最深刻的洞见。它不是关于数据太少——而是关于模型的逻辑结构。

想象你观察一个市场的价格和数量数据。供给和需求都因各种因素随时间变动。如果供给移动但需求不变，数据描绘出需求曲线。如果需求移动但供给不变，数据描绘出供给曲线。但如果两者同时移动，数据既不描绘供给也不描绘需求——只是一团均衡点。

要识别一个方程，你需要**排除性约束**——影响一个方程但不影响另一个的变量。天气影响农业供给但不影响需求；收入影响需求但不影响供给。这些被排除的变量提供了解开系统所需的杠杆。

这一框架——先识别后估计——成为所有结构计量经济学的方法论基础，至今仍是因果推断的核心。

## 遗产：从哈维尔莫到现代因果推断

哈维尔莫的工作确立了至今仍指导实证经济学的原则：

- **因果关系需要结构**：你不能仅从相关性确定因果关系。你需要一个关于变量如何被决定的模型——什么导致什么——然后检验数据是否与该模型一致
- **工具变量**：联立性偏差的实际解决方案——找到与内生回归变量相关但与误差项不相关的变量——直接源于哈维尔莫的识别框架
- **可信度革命**：现代计量经济学对研究设计、自然实验和因果识别的强调，可以追溯到哈维尔莫的坚持：没有识别的估计是毫无意义的

他1989年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对计量经济学概率论基础的阐明以及对联立经济结构的分析。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象你想弄清楚是吃冰淇淋让人去游泳，还是游泳让人吃冰淇淋。你注意到卖出很多冰淇淋的日子，也有很多人游泳。但两者都是因为天热——高温同时导致了两者。如果你只看数字，你可能会错误地得出冰淇淋导致游泳的结论。哈维尔莫在经济学中发现了完全相同的问题——当两件事同时互相影响时，你不能只是画一条线穿过数据就当作答案。你需要一个巧妙的方法来解开什么真正导致了什么。
