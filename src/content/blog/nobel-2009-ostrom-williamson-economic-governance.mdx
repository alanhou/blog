## The Missing Middle of Economics

Traditional economics offered two ways to organize economic activity: markets and governments. If markets fail, the government steps in. If government fails, let the market handle it. This binary view dominated policy debates for decades.

The 2009 Nobel Prize went to two scholars who showed this was a false dichotomy. Elinor Ostrom — the first woman to win the economics Nobel — demonstrated that communities can successfully govern shared resources through self-organized institutions, without either privatization or state control. Oliver Williamson showed that firms themselves are governance structures, existing precisely because some transactions are too complex or risky for open markets.

Together, they revealed the rich institutional landscape between the market and the state.

## Ostrom: Governing the Commons

In 1968, Garrett Hardin published "The Tragedy of the Commons" — arguing that shared resources are doomed to overexploitation. If a pasture is open to all herders, each has an incentive to add one more cow, because the benefit goes to the individual while the cost of overgrazing is shared. The inevitable result: destruction of the commons. The prescribed solutions: privatize the resource or impose government regulation.

Elinor Ostrom spent her career proving Hardin wrong — not in theory, but with evidence.

Through decades of fieldwork and case studies across the world, she documented hundreds of cases where communities successfully managed common-pool resources for centuries:

- **Swiss alpine meadows**: Villages have managed shared grazing lands since the Middle Ages through detailed rules about how many cows each family can graze, enforced by community monitoring
- **Japanese forests**: Communities developed elaborate systems of shared forest management, with rules about harvesting, replanting, and punishment for violations
- **Spanish irrigation systems**: Farmers along the Huerta of Valencia have managed shared water for over 500 years through self-governing institutions — the Tribunal de las Aguas, which meets every Thursday to resolve disputes
- **Maine lobster fisheries**: Lobstermen enforce informal territorial rules that prevent overfishing, without government regulation

**Ostrom's design principles** — the conditions under which commons governance succeeds:

1. **Clear boundaries**: Who has rights to the resource must be well-defined
2. **Rules match local conditions**: One-size-fits-all regulation fails; rules must fit the specific resource and community
3. **Collective choice**: Those affected by the rules participate in making them
4. **Monitoring**: Community members monitor each other's compliance — not distant bureaucrats
5. **Graduated sanctions**: Punishments start mild and escalate for repeat offenders
6. **Conflict resolution**: Cheap, accessible mechanisms for resolving disputes
7. **Recognized rights**: External authorities respect the community's right to self-organize
8. **Nested enterprises**: For larger systems, governance is organized in multiple layers — local, regional, national — each handling problems at the appropriate scale

This was **polycentric governance** — multiple overlapping centers of authority, each adapted to local conditions, rather than a single top-down solution.

## Williamson: Why Firms Exist

Ronald Coase asked in 1937 why firms exist if markets are efficient. Oliver Williamson provided the detailed answer, building **transaction cost economics** into a comprehensive theory of economic organization.

The core insight: **every transaction has costs beyond the price** — costs of finding trading partners, negotiating contracts, monitoring performance, and enforcing agreements. When these transaction costs are high, it's cheaper to bring the activity inside a firm than to conduct it through the market.

What makes transaction costs high?

- **Asset specificity**: When an investment is tailored to a specific trading relationship, the investor becomes vulnerable to exploitation. A supplier who builds a factory next to a particular customer's plant can't easily switch customers — creating a "hold-up problem." Vertical integration (bringing the supplier inside the firm) solves this
- **Uncertainty**: When the future is unpredictable, writing complete contracts is impossible. Firms handle uncertainty through authority — a manager can direct employees to adapt, while a market contract must be renegotiated
- **Frequency**: Transactions that occur repeatedly justify the overhead of building an organizational structure to handle them

Williamson's framework explains the boundaries of the firm:

- **Make or buy?**: A company should produce internally when asset specificity is high, uncertainty is great, and transactions are frequent. It should buy from the market when assets are generic and contracts are straightforward
- **Hybrid forms**: Between pure market and pure hierarchy lie joint ventures, long-term contracts, franchises, and alliances — each a governance structure adapted to specific transaction characteristics
- **The firm as conflict resolution**: Williamson saw the firm not as a production function but as a **governance structure** — a way of resolving the inevitable conflicts that arise in complex economic relationships. Courts are slow and expensive; internal authority is fast and flexible

## The Shared Vision

Ostrom and Williamson, working independently, reached a common conclusion: **economic governance is far richer than the market-versus-state dichotomy suggests.**

- Ostrom showed that communities create governance institutions from the bottom up — without markets or states
- Williamson showed that firms are governance institutions that handle transactions too complex for markets
- Both emphasized that institutions evolve to solve specific problems, and the best institution depends on context

Their 2009 Nobel Prize was awarded to Ostrom "for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons" and to Williamson "for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm."

## Explain It to a Child

> Imagine a neighborhood with a shared garden. Everyone can plant and pick vegetables. The worry is that everyone will pick too much and plant too little — and the garden dies. Some people say: "Divide it into private plots!" Others say: "The city should hire a guard!" But Ostrom found that in real life, neighbors often figure it out themselves — they make rules like "pick only what you planted" and "everyone weeds on Saturday," and they watch each other to make sure it's fair. It works because they talk to each other and care about the garden's future. Now Williamson asked a different question: why do companies exist? Why doesn't everyone just freelance? Because some jobs need people to work together so closely that hiring and firing through the market every day would be chaos. It's easier to put everyone under one roof with a boss who can say "you do this, you do that" — that's what a company is for.

## 经济学缺失的中间地带

传统经济学提供了两种组织经济活动的方式：市场和政府。如果市场失灵，政府介入。如果政府失灵，让市场处理。这种二元观点主导了数十年的政策辩论。

2009年诺贝尔奖授予了两位证明这是虚假二分法的学者。奥斯特罗姆——第一位获得经济学诺贝尔奖的女性——证明社区可以通过自组织制度成功治理共享资源，无需私有化或国家控制。威廉姆森证明企业本身就是治理结构，之所以存在恰恰是因为某些交易对开放市场来说太复杂或风险太大。

他们共同揭示了市场与国家之间丰富的制度景观。

## 奥斯特罗姆：治理公共资源

1968年，哈丁发表了《公地悲剧》——论证共享资源注定被过度开发。如果牧场对所有牧民开放，每个人都有动机多加一头牛，因为收益归个人而过度放牧的成本由大家分担。不可避免的结果：公地毁灭。开出的药方：将资源私有化或实施政府管制。

奥斯特罗姆用毕生事业证明哈丁是错的——不是在理论上，而是用证据。

通过数十年的田野调查和全球案例研究，她记录了数百个社区成功管理公共池塘资源数百年的案例：

- **瑞士高山草甸**：村庄自中世纪以来通过关于每个家庭可以放牧多少头牛的详细规则管理共享牧场，由社区监督执行
- **日本森林**：社区发展了精心设计的共享森林管理系统，包括关于采伐、重新种植和违规惩罚的规则
- **西班牙灌溉系统**：瓦伦西亚韦尔塔的农民通过自治机构管理共享水资源超过500年——水法庭每周四开会解决纠纷
- **缅因州龙虾渔业**：龙虾渔民执行非正式的领地规则防止过度捕捞，无需政府管制

**奥斯特罗姆的设计原则**——公共资源治理成功的条件：

1. **清晰的边界**：谁有权使用资源必须明确界定
2. **规则匹配当地条件**：一刀切的管制会失败；规则必须适合特定资源和社区
3. **集体选择**：受规则影响的人参与制定规则
4. **监督**：社区成员互相监督合规——而非遥远的官僚
5. **渐进制裁**：惩罚从轻微开始，对累犯逐步升级
6. **冲突解决**：廉价、可及的纠纷解决机制
7. **被认可的权利**：外部权威尊重社区的自组织权利
8. **嵌套式组织**：对于更大的系统，治理组织为多层——地方、区域、国家——每层处理适当规模的问题

这就是**多中心治理**——多个重叠的权威中心，各自适应当地条件，而非单一的自上而下解决方案。

## 威廉姆森：企业为什么存在

科斯在1937年问过，如果市场是有效的，企业为什么存在。威廉姆森提供了详细答案，将**交易成本经济学**构建为一个全面的经济组织理论。

核心洞见：**每笔交易都有超出价格的成本**——寻找交易伙伴、谈判合同、监督履行和执行协议的成本。当这些交易成本很高时，将活动纳入企业内部比通过市场进行更便宜。

什么使交易成本升高？

- **资产专用性**：当投资针对特定交易关系定制时，投资者容易被剥削。一个在特定客户工厂旁边建厂的供应商不能轻易更换客户——造成"敲竹杠问题"。纵向整合（将供应商纳入企业内部）解决了这个问题
- **不确定性**：当未来不可预测时，编写完整合同是不可能的。企业通过权威处理不确定性——经理可以指挥员工适应，而市场合同必须重新谈判
- **频率**：反复发生的交易证明了建立组织结构来处理它们的管理费用是合理的

威廉姆森的框架解释了企业的边界：

- **自制还是外购？**：当资产专用性高、不确定性大、交易频繁时，公司应该内部生产。当资产是通用的、合同是直接的时，应该从市场购买
- **混合形式**：在纯市场和纯层级之间是合资企业、长期合同、特许经营和联盟——每种都是适应特定交易特征的治理结构
- **企业作为冲突解决机制**：威廉姆森将企业视为不是生产函数而是**治理结构**——一种解决复杂经济关系中不可避免冲突的方式。法院缓慢且昂贵；内部权威快速且灵活

## 共同的愿景

奥斯特罗姆和威廉姆森独立工作，得出了共同结论：**经济治理远比市场对国家的二分法所暗示的丰富得多。**

- 奥斯特罗姆证明社区自下而上创造治理制度——无需市场或国家
- 威廉姆森证明企业是处理对市场来说太复杂的交易的治理制度
- 两者都强调制度演化以解决特定问题，最佳制度取决于情境

他们2009年的诺贝尔奖授予奥斯特罗姆"因其对经济治理的分析，特别是公共资源"，授予威廉姆森"因其对经济治理的分析，特别是企业边界"。

## 讲给小孩听

> 想象一个有共享花园的社区。每个人都可以种菜和摘菜。担心的是每个人都摘太多种太少——花园就死了。有人说："分成私人地块！"其他人说："市政府应该雇个看守！"但奥斯特罗姆发现在现实中，邻居们经常自己想出办法——他们制定规则比如"只摘你种的"和"每个人周六除草"，他们互相监督确保公平。这行得通是因为他们互相交流并关心花园的未来。而威廉姆森问了一个不同的问题：公司为什么存在？为什么不是每个人都做自由职业者？因为有些工作需要人们如此紧密地合作，每天通过市场雇用和解雇会是一团糟。把每个人放在一个屋檐下，有个老板可以说"你做这个，你做那个"更容易——这就是公司的用途。
