This post summarizes Michael Truell's interview at Y Combinator (September 2025) about building Cursor, the AI-powered code editor that's challenging GitHub Copilot.

## The Origin Story

Michael Truell and his co-founders started Cursor when they were 23 years old. They didn't begin with coding tools - their first project was actually about CAD (Computer-Aided Design).

### The CAD Pivot

The team was initially excited about applying AI to CAD and 3D modeling. They spent time scraping CAD models from the internet, dealing with various file formats, and trying to convert them into something canonical. However, they realized they were really inherently excited about the future of coding.

They took a step back and realized that if they were being really consistent with their beliefs about where AI was heading, they should work on something they were genuinely passionate about - and that was coding.

### Why Coding?

The team believed:
- AI would be transformative technology, perhaps more so than any technological revolution in recent centuries
- It would take a couple of decades to fully transform knowledge work
- There would be lots of incredibly valuable things to build over the next few decades
- Coding was the area they were most excited about

## The VS Code Decision

One of the most critical decisions was whether to build a plugin for VS Code or fork it entirely.

### Why Fork Instead of Plugin?

The team thought forking VS Code would be "a way, way, way longer road." VS Code had been developed over 12 years, was one of the earliest TypeScript projects, and had lots of people working on it.

However, they realized that to build the best AI coding experience, they needed deep integration that a plugin couldn't provide. The fork allowed them to:
- Control the entire user experience
- Integrate AI at every level of the editor
- Move faster on AI-specific features
- Not be constrained by plugin API limitations

### The Competitive Landscape

When they started in 2022, working on AI was considered "kind of weird." People weren't entirely convinced that there would be lots of great applications from AI. Even people interested in AI were either:
- Focused on optimizing existing form factors (making products a little bit better)
- Asking "why would you work on anything other than AGI?"

The team took a middle road bet - believing there would be valuable products to build during the AI transition, not just at the end state.

## Competing with GitHub Copilot

The interview touched on how Cursor differentiates from GitHub Copilot:

### The Approach

- **Deep integration**: Rather than being a plugin, Cursor is a full editor built around AI
- **User experience**: Every interaction is designed with AI in mind
- **Speed of iteration**: As an independent company, they can move faster on AI features

### The Market View

The team believes that for professional engineers:
- Code is still really important
- There will be a "long messy middle" where you work with AI more and more
- AI will become like a colleague
- It may also become like a very advanced compiler that can hide some of the code for you
- You'll still need to read the logic, review it, and edit it

## Building the Team

### Staying Small

The team was very patient early on with hiring. They ended 2023 with only single-digit employees - less than 10 people. This was intentional:
- They believed they could go pretty far without hiring anyone
- They had their own set of missteps figuring out the first people to hire
- They focused on hiring a lot less than they probably should have early on

### Hiring Philosophy

When hiring, they looked for people who:
- Were genuinely interested in the problem
- Could work independently
- Shared their vision for the future of coding

## The Future of Coding

### The Long View

Michael believes:
- AI is going to be transformative technology
- It will take a couple of decades to fully transform software development
- It's an industry-wide effort with many independent capabilities that need to develop
- There are lots of incredibly valuable things to build

### What Skills Still Matter?

When asked what skills will still matter:

> "Programming, like math, is kind of just a good general education. I don't think that goes away."

He also noted:
- There are lots of practical skills from studying computer science
- The specific stuff studied in school isn't super crucial in dynamic industries
- It's more about the kind of learning you get along the way
- This hasn't changed with AI

## Advice for Engineering Students

For young people who want to follow a similar path:

### Focus on What Interests You

> "I think just working on things that you're interested in and doing it with people both that you enjoy being around but that you respect a ton. And taking that really seriously."

### Avoid Box-Checking

For people in school, there are so many things that pull you toward:
- Checking boxes
- Less focusing on building something up over time

Instead, focus on:
- Building something you're genuinely interested in
- Working with people you respect
- Taking your work seriously

## Key Takeaways

1. **Follow your genuine interests** - The team pivoted from CAD to coding because that's what they were truly excited about
2. **Make bold technical decisions** - Forking VS Code seemed like the longer road but enabled deeper AI integration
3. **Stay small and focused** - Less than 10 people through 2023 allowed them to move fast
4. **Take the middle road** - Not just optimizing existing products, not waiting for AGI, but building valuable tools during the transition
5. **Programming education still matters** - Like math, it's good general education that won't go away
6. **Work with people you respect** - Both enjoying their company and respecting their abilities

本文总结了 Michael Truell 在 Y Combinator（2025年9月）关于创建 Cursor 的访谈，这是一款正在挑战 GitHub Copilot 的 AI 驱动代码编辑器。

## 起源故事

Michael Truell 和他的联合创始人在 23 岁时创建了 Cursor。他们并非一开始就做编程工具——他们的第一个项目实际上是关于 CAD（计算机辅助设计）的。

### CAD 转型

团队最初对将 AI 应用于 CAD 和 3D 建模感到兴奋。他们花时间从互联网上抓取 CAD 模型，处理各种文件格式，并尝试将它们转换成标准格式。然而，他们意识到自己真正内心深处对编程的未来更感兴趣。

他们退后一步，意识到如果他们真正坚持自己对 AI 发展方向的信念，就应该做自己真正热爱的事情——那就是编程。

### 为什么选择编程？

团队相信：
- AI 将是变革性技术，可能比近几个世纪的任何技术革命都更具影响力
- 完全改变知识工作需要几十年时间
- 未来几十年将有大量极具价值的东西可以构建
- 编程是他们最感兴趣的领域

## VS Code 的决定

最关键的决定之一是构建 VS Code 插件还是完全 fork 它。

### 为什么选择 Fork 而不是插件？

团队认为 fork VS Code 将是"一条漫长得多的路"。VS Code 已经开发了 12 年，是最早的 TypeScript 项目之一，有很多人在开发它。

然而，他们意识到要构建最好的 AI 编程体验，需要插件无法提供的深度集成。Fork 使他们能够：
- 控制整个用户体验
- 在编辑器的每个层面集成 AI
- 更快地推进 AI 特定功能
- 不受插件 API 限制的约束

### 竞争格局

当他们在 2022 年开始时，从事 AI 工作被认为"有点奇怪"。人们并不完全相信 AI 会产生很多优秀的应用。即使对 AI 感兴趣的人也要么：
- 专注于优化现有形态（让产品稍微好一点）
- 问"为什么要做 AGI 以外的事情？"

团队选择了中间路线——相信在 AI 转型期间会有有价值的产品可以构建，而不仅仅是在最终状态。

## 与 GitHub Copilot 竞争

访谈涉及了 Cursor 如何与 GitHub Copilot 差异化：

### 方法

- **深度集成**：Cursor 不是插件，而是围绕 AI 构建的完整编辑器
- **用户体验**：每个交互都是以 AI 为核心设计的
- **迭代速度**：作为独立公司，他们可以更快地推进 AI 功能

### 市场观点

团队认为对于专业工程师：
- 代码仍然非常重要
- 会有一个"漫长混乱的中间期"，你会越来越多地与 AI 合作
- AI 会越来越像同事
- 它也可能变成一个非常先进的编译器，可以为你隐藏一些代码
- 你仍然需要阅读逻辑、审查它并编辑它

## 团队建设

### 保持小规模

团队在早期招聘方面非常有耐心。他们在 2023 年底只有个位数的员工——不到 10 人。这是有意为之的：
- 他们相信不招人也能走很远
- 他们在确定第一批招聘人选时有自己的一些失误
- 他们早期在招聘上的关注比应该的要少得多

### 招聘理念

招聘时，他们寻找：
- 真正对问题感兴趣的人
- 能够独立工作的人
- 认同他们对编程未来愿景的人

## 编程的未来

### 长远观点

Michael 认为：
- AI 将是变革性技术
- 完全改变软件开发需要几十年时间
- 这是一个全行业的努力，有许多独立的能力需要发展
- 有大量极具价值的东西可以构建

### 哪些技能仍然重要？

当被问到哪些技能仍然重要时：

> "编程，就像数学一样，是一种很好的通识教育。我认为这不会消失。"

他还指出：
- 学习计算机科学有很多实用技能
- 在动态行业中，学校里学的具体内容并不是最关键的
- 更重要的是你在过程中获得的学习能力
- 这一点并没有因为 AI 而改变

## 给工程学生的建议

对于想走类似道路的年轻人：

### 专注于你感兴趣的事情

> "我认为就是做你感兴趣的事情，和你喜欢相处但又非常尊重的人一起做。并且认真对待这件事。"

### 避免打勾式思维

对于在校学生，有太多东西把你拉向：
- 打勾完成任务
- 而不是专注于长期构建某些东西

相反，应该专注于：
- 构建你真正感兴趣的东西
- 与你尊重的人一起工作
- 认真对待你的工作

## 关键要点

1. **追随真正的兴趣** - 团队从 CAD 转向编程，因为那才是他们真正兴奋的领域
2. **做出大胆的技术决策** - Fork VS Code 看起来是更长的路，但实现了更深的 AI 集成
3. **保持小而专注** - 2023 年全年不到 10 人让他们能够快速行动
4. **走中间路线** - 不只是优化现有产品，不等待 AGI，而是在转型期构建有价值的工具
5. **编程教育仍然重要** - 像数学一样，是不会消失的良好通识教育
6. **与你尊重的人一起工作** - 既享受他们的陪伴，又尊重他们的能力
