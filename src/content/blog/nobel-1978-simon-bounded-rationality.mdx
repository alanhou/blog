## Humans Don't Optimize — They Satisfice

Classical economics rests on a heroic assumption: people are perfectly rational. They gather all available information, consider every possible option, calculate the expected outcome of each, and choose the one that maximizes their utility. It's a beautiful model — and Herbert Simon thought it was nonsense.

Not because people are stupid, but because the world is too complex. Information is incomplete. Time is limited. Our brains have finite processing power. In the real world — especially inside organizations where most economic decisions actually happen — people don't optimize. They look for solutions that are *good enough*. Simon called this **satisficing** (a blend of "satisfy" and "suffice"), and the broader framework **bounded rationality**.

This wasn't just a minor correction to economic theory. It was a fundamental challenge to its foundations — and it opened the door to behavioral economics, organizational theory, and artificial intelligence.

## The Problem with "Economic Man"

Standard economic theory models humans as *homo economicus* — perfectly rational agents with unlimited computational ability, complete information, and clear preferences. This "economic man" always finds the optimal solution.

Simon identified three reasons why this is unrealistic:

- **Information limits**: You can't know everything. Gathering information is costly and time-consuming. Most decisions must be made with incomplete data
- **Cognitive limits**: Even with perfect information, the human brain can't process it all. We can't evaluate millions of options simultaneously or calculate complex probabilities in our heads
- **Time limits**: Decisions must be made under deadlines. The world doesn't wait while you compute the optimal answer

The result: real decision-makers use **heuristics** — rules of thumb, shortcuts, and simplified models — not global optimization.

## Satisficing: Good Enough Is Good Enough

Simon's alternative to optimization was **satisficing**. Instead of searching for the best possible option, a satisficer sets an aspiration level — a threshold of acceptability — and chooses the first option that meets it.

Looking for an apartment? The optimizer would visit every listing in the city, rank them all, and pick the best. The satisficer decides: "I need two bedrooms, under $1,500, within 30 minutes of work" — and takes the first place that qualifies. In a complex world with search costs, satisficing is often more rational than optimizing.

This insight applies powerfully to organizations:

- **Firms don't maximize profit** in the textbook sense — they set targets and adjust behavior when targets aren't met
- **Managers use routines and rules** rather than recalculating from scratch for every decision
- **Organizations develop standard operating procedures** that work well enough most of the time, and only change them when performance falls below acceptable levels

## Administrative Behavior: How Organizations Really Decide

Simon's 1947 book *Administrative Behavior* — written when he was just 30 — revolutionized organizational theory. He argued that to understand economic decisions, you must understand the organizations in which they're made.

Key insights:

- **Organizations shape rationality**: The structure of an organization — its hierarchy, information channels, division of labor — determines what information reaches decision-makers and what options they consider. Rationality is not just bounded by individual cognition but by organizational design
- **The authority relationship**: People in organizations don't just follow their own preferences — they accept the authority of the organization, following instructions and procedures. This is fundamentally different from the autonomous agents of economic theory
- **Identification with organizational goals**: Employees internalize the goals of their department or unit, which simplifies decision-making but can create conflicts between subunits — each optimizing locally while the whole organization suffers
- **The distinction between programmed and non-programmed decisions**: Routine decisions can be handled by rules and procedures; novel decisions require judgment, creativity, and search. Organizations must design different processes for each

## Beyond Economics: AI and Cognitive Science

Simon's intellectual range was extraordinary. His work on bounded rationality led him directly into two other fields:

- **Artificial intelligence**: With Allen Newell, Simon created the Logic Theorist (1956) and the General Problem Solver — among the first AI programs. Their approach modeled AI on human problem-solving: heuristic search, means-ends analysis, and satisficing rather than brute-force optimization. Simon received the Turing Award in 1975 for these contributions
- **Cognitive psychology**: Simon studied how chess players, scientists, and managers actually think — using protocol analysis (having people think aloud while solving problems). He showed that expertise consists largely of pattern recognition built from experience, not raw computational power
- **The science of design**: Simon argued that the proper study of human-made systems — organizations, computers, economies — requires a "science of the artificial" distinct from natural science, focused on how things *ought to be* rather than how they *are*

## Why It Matters

Simon's bounded rationality didn't just critique economic theory — it opened entirely new research programs:

- **Behavioral economics** (Kahneman, Tversky, Thaler) built directly on Simon's foundation, studying systematic biases in human decision-making
- **Organizational economics** took seriously the idea that firms are not black boxes but complex decision-making structures
- **Mechanism design** asks how to structure institutions so that boundedly rational agents make good decisions
- **AI and machine learning** continue to grapple with the trade-off between optimization and satisficing that Simon identified

His 1978 Nobel Prize was awarded "for his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations."

## Explain It to a Child

> Classical economics says people are like supercomputers — they always find the perfect answer. Simon said: no, people are more like someone shopping in a huge store with no map and only 10 minutes. You don't check every single item to find the absolute best deal. You walk down a few aisles, find something that looks good and fits your budget, and you buy it. That's not irrational — it's the smartest thing you can do when you don't have unlimited time and brainpower. Simon called it "satisficing" — finding what's good enough.

## 人类不会最优化——他们满意化

古典经济学建立在一个英雄式的假设之上：人是完全理性的。他们收集所有可用信息，考虑每一个可能的选项，计算每个选项的预期结果，然后选择效用最大化的那个。这是一个漂亮的模型——而赫伯特·西蒙认为它是荒谬的。

不是因为人们愚蠢，而是因为世界太复杂了。信息是不完整的。时间是有限的。我们的大脑处理能力有限。在现实世界中——尤其是在大多数经济决策实际发生的组织内部——人们不会最优化。他们寻找*足够好*的解决方案。西蒙称之为**满意化**（satisficing，"满意"和"足够"的混合词），更广泛的框架则是**有限理性**。

这不仅仅是对经济理论的小修正，而是对其根基的根本挑战——它打开了通向行为经济学、组织理论和人工智能的大门。

## "经济人"的问题

标准经济理论将人类建模为*经济人*——拥有无限计算能力、完全信息和清晰偏好的完全理性主体。这个"经济人"总能找到最优解。

西蒙指出了这为何不现实的三个原因：

- **信息限制**：你不可能知道一切。收集信息是昂贵且耗时的。大多数决策必须在不完整数据下做出
- **认知限制**：即使有完美信息，人脑也无法全部处理。我们无法同时评估数百万个选项或在脑中计算复杂概率
- **时间限制**：决策必须在截止期限内做出。世界不会在你计算最优答案时停下来等你

结果是：真实的决策者使用**启发式方法**——经验法则、捷径和简化模型——而非全局优化。

## 满意化：足够好就是足够好

西蒙对优化的替代方案是**满意化**。满意化者不是搜索最佳选项，而是设定一个期望水平——一个可接受的门槛——然后选择第一个达到门槛的选项。

找公寓？优化者会看遍全城每一个房源，全部排名，选最好的。满意化者决定："我需要两间卧室、1500元以下、上班30分钟以内"——然后租下第一个符合条件的。在搜索成本高昂的复杂世界中，满意化往往比优化更理性。

这一洞见对组织有强大的适用性：

- **企业不会教科书式地利润最大化**——它们设定目标，在目标未达成时调整行为
- **管理者使用惯例和规则**，而非每次决策都从头计算
- **组织发展出标准操作程序**，大多数时候运作良好，只在绩效低于可接受水平时才改变

## 管理行为：组织如何真正做决策

西蒙1947年的著作《管理行为》——写于他年仅30岁时——革新了组织理论。他论证，要理解经济决策，必须理解做出决策的组织。

关键洞见：

- **组织塑造理性**：组织的结构——层级、信息渠道、分工——决定了什么信息到达决策者手中、什么选项被考虑。理性不仅受个人认知限制，还受组织设计限制
- **权威关系**：组织中的人不只是遵循自己的偏好——他们接受组织的权威，遵循指令和程序。这与经济理论中的自主主体根本不同
- **对组织目标的认同**：员工内化了所在部门或单位的目标，这简化了决策，但可能造成子单位之间的冲突——每个部分局部优化，而整个组织受损
- **程序化决策与非程序化决策的区分**：常规决策可以用规则和程序处理；新颖决策需要判断力、创造力和搜索。组织必须为两者设计不同的流程

## 超越经济学：人工智能与认知科学

西蒙的智识跨度非凡。他关于有限理性的工作直接引领他进入另外两个领域：

- **人工智能**：与艾伦·纽厄尔合作，西蒙创造了逻辑理论家（1956年）和通用问题求解器——最早的AI程序之一。他们的方法以人类问题解决为模型：启发式搜索、手段-目的分析和满意化，而非暴力穷举优化。西蒙因这些贡献于1975年获得图灵奖
- **认知心理学**：西蒙研究了棋手、科学家和管理者实际上如何思考——使用出声思维法（让人在解决问题时大声说出思考过程）。他证明专业技能主要由经验积累的模式识别构成，而非原始计算能力
- **设计科学**：西蒙论证，对人造系统——组织、计算机、经济——的恰当研究需要一种不同于自然科学的"人工科学"，关注事物*应该如何*而非*实际如何*

## 为什么重要

西蒙的有限理性不仅批判了经济理论——它开启了全新的研究方向：

- **行为经济学**（卡尼曼、特沃斯基、塞勒）直接建立在西蒙的基础上，研究人类决策中的系统性偏差
- **组织经济学**认真对待企业不是黑箱而是复杂决策结构的观点
- **机制设计**追问如何构建制度，使有限理性的主体做出好的决策
- **AI和机器学习**至今仍在应对西蒙所识别的优化与满意化之间的权衡

他1978年的诺贝尔奖授奖词为："因其对经济组织内决策过程的开创性研究。"

## 讲给小孩听

> 古典经济学说人们像超级计算机——总能找到完美答案。西蒙说：不，人们更像是在一个巨大的商店里没有地图、只有10分钟的购物者。你不会检查每一件商品来找到绝对最划算的。你走过几个货架，找到看起来不错又在预算内的东西，就买了。这不是不理性——当你没有无限的时间和脑力时，这是你能做的最聪明的事。西蒙把它叫做"满意化"——找到足够好的。
